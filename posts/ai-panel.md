In case you missed it, last week we hosted legendary AI Researcher [Jim Fan](https://jimfan.me/) from NVIDIA AI for an incredible discussion on all things Generative AI. During a one-hour conversation with Amjad Masad, CEO and co-founder of Replit, and Michele Catasta, Replit's ML Advisor, the group discussed the recent advancements in AI and the potential impact of multi-modality on the field.

## Event Recap

Jim Fan has worked in AI for a decade and has collaborated with several prominent AI researchers. He highlights the growth of AI from image recognition to large language models like GPT-4. Amjad shares his background in developer tools and his excitement about applying machine learning and statistical approaches to code.

[2:50](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=170) - The discussion starts with the recent [NVIDIA GTC](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/) event, with Jim describing NVIDIA's transition from a hardware provider to an enterprise-focused AI provider. He is mainly excited about [NVIDIA AI Foundations](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1638211601944948736), which offer customization services that allow enterprises to create unique use cases with multimodal language models. These models will also help incorporate images, videos, and 3D data into AI systems.

[5:45](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=345) - Michele highlights the importance of multi-modality and how it grants superpowers in communications with computers. Jim envisions a range of possibilities with multi-modal language models, including being able to interact with more natural human input, enhancing note-taking, and automating home decoration plans.

[11:10](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=670) - The group takes a deep dive into LLMs, specifically focusing on user experience. Amjad reflects on the newest influx of LLMs on the block, noting how the chat interface of ChatGPT made LLMs accessible to everyone.

[21:50](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=1310) - Michele notes that the size or number of parameters for a specific model is no longer reflective of its power. Jim explains reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning, and constitutional AI. 

[37:15](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=2235) - The group considers GPT-4, its strengths and weaknesses, and what it means for the future of generative AI. 

[40:55](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=2455) - Models are becoming more and more powerful over several different programming languages - how do we optimize AI for coding? Jim summarizes the GitHub Copilot X launch and the four major features. 

[48:15](https://youtu.be/IAbhei16pL8?t=2895) - LLMs are the new computer of this decade. Amjad predicts the future for both beginner coders who are using AI at the start of their journeys, as well as professional developers. Jim explores what the world will look like a year from now. 

The future of AI is more exciting than ever. Multi-modal language models will continue to expand and offer endless possibilities. By incorporating various sensory signals in addition to text, AI systems will become more powerful and versatile, leading to groundbreaking innovations in a variety of industries.
