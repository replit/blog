Since we introduced [templates](http://replit.com/templates), many of you have asked to get in on the action. We have some amazing community templates already, but we want to get everyone involved.

We've been hard at work revamping both the templates page and publishing flow so that everyone can create and publish a template. We're rolling this out over the next week, so keep your eyes peeled!

To celebrate this new release, on May 23rd, we're bringing Template Jam [back](https://replit.com/talk/announcements/template_jam-EXTENDED/33491). This time there will be $10,000 USD in prizes and you'll have the power of [Nix](https://blog.replit.com/nix) behind you. 

We're excited to see all the wonderful templates you create, and brand new ways for people to create on Replit.

### What are templates and how do I make one?

Templates are repls that serve as a starting point for others to build on top of. 

Templates can be blank repls with support for a single language like many of the official templates are. Or they can be [portfolio website starter kits](https://replit.com/@templates/Portfolio-Site-Template?v=1) or [PyPi package templates](https://replit.com/@frissyn/PyPI-Package-Template?v=1). They can also be tutorials for languages or frameworks. The possibilities are endless, really.

Check out [these docs](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl) on how to configure a repl to get your template working with any language or framework.

### What kind of templates should I make?

It's up to you! Our community has some ideas on what templates they'd like to see if you want some inspiration:
- A [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) starter
- The [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises
- A [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) starter
- A [Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/)

And our team has some ideas on things we'd like to see as well:

- A simple static hosted blog without a frameworkâ€”like [Replit's own](https://blog.replit.com/__repl)
- [Figma Plugins](https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/)
- A [Shopify theme](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/topics/shopify-theme-development)
- [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html)
- An [Oculus app starter](https://developers.google.com/assistant)
- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net)

### How can I submit my template for Template Jam?

Publish a repl to the community as a template and add the tag `#templatejam`. It's that simple!

We will start collecting submissions May 23rd at 12:00 AM PST, and stop collecting submissions June 23rd at 11:59 PM PST. 

### How are winners decided?

You'll have two ways to win!

The first $5,000 in prizes will be awarded by a panel of judges reviewing templates based on several criteria. This panel will include some Replit team members and a couple of guest judges. When reviewing, we'll be asking ourselves questions like:
- How useful is it? _Does it extend the capabilities of what people can build on Replit?_
- How easy is it to use? _Can a beginner press run and it just works?_
- How well does it make use of Replit's features? (i.e. Replit DB, Kaboom.js, Repl Auth, LSP, packager, debugger, etc.)
 - Is it well-documented? _Is it easy to understand what's going on?_

The second $5,000 in prizes will be awarded based on a secret formula that will measure community reception of the templates in the month following the end of submission.

### How much can I win?

You can win anywhere from $50 USD up to $5,000 USD.

### How many templates can I submit ?

You can submit as many templates as you like! There is no limit.

### Can I remix existing templates?

Yes, as long as you're adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the template.
