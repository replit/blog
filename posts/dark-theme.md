Dark Theme has long been one of the most highly request features on Repl.it.  We introduced a dark theme editor some time back, but as the rest of the workspace was still in "Repl.it Light Mode", we knew our work wasn't done.  We are proud to announce the release of "Repl.it Dark" - a dark theme for the entire workspace!

To enable Dark Mode, just go to any workspace, open up the Options/Settings pane on the sidebar, and select "dark" as your theme.

And voila!  Your entire workspace should then change to darkmode!

We'll be iterating on the darkmode to improve its look.  Have any feedback?  Leave us a suggestion [here](https://repl.it/feedback/p/dark-mode-for-user-interface-more-themessyntax-highlighting).  Furthermore, we designed it in a way where in the future, you'll be able to create and share your own themes for the Repl.it workspace!

What's next?  Maybe Repl.it Dark Theme everywhere?  Maybe Custom Themes?  What would you like to see?  Let us know on our [feedback boards](https://repl.it/feedback).
