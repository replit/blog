Very excited to announce we are now making Replit's Teams for Education product free for all teachers and students!

Replitâ€™s goal is to bring the next [billion software creators](https://blog.replit.com/b) online. One avenue to advance this mission is giving educators free access to Replit.

Not only are teachers pivotal to inspiring the next generation of creators and engineers, but they are the backbone of the Replit community. 

Replit is for people. Millions of people are already using Replit to explore their own curiosities, realize their own goals, make things that matter, and have fun. We want to give every learner around the world the opportunity to develop coding superpowers, whether their school has a big budget or none at all.

Replit is for equity. Lack of access to education is a global issue. We want to be a part of the solution by ensuring access for non-profit organizations, low-income school districts, and educators in developing countries.

Replit is for simplicity. Replit is based on the idea that coding can be done anywhere, from any device, without any set-up. We want to make Replit even simpler and eliminate the purchasing hassle as well.

An environment for learning and creating is the cornerstone of Replit. We will continue to support, advocate, and nurture our Replit [teacher community.](https://community.replit.com/c/edu/10)

Be a part of bringing the next billion software creators online. Teach the power of Replit.
