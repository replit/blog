Our teacher community is so pivotal to growth that we want to reward you for referring educators to Teams for Education AND give you the chance to earn swag from our new [ReplShop](https://shop.replit.com/)! 

As we strive to bring the next [billion software creators online](https://blog.replit.com/operating-principles), our various communities will continue to be instrumental in acheiving this mission.

Who better to refer Replit to others than trusted colleagues, students, and friends? After all, you are the reason we are here.

## How does the referral process work?
1. Encourage your professors, teachers, coding camp directors, or fellow educators to go to `replit.com/teams` and sign up for free access to Teams for Education.
2. Ensure your name is added as the referral on the verificaiton form so you get the recognition. 
3. Once your referral is marked as a verified user and creates their first team, you will start to receive credits for the Replshop for EVERY referral.
4. Purchase your swag at the [ReplShop](https://shop.replit.com/) and post on your socials with #replitswag to show off your new swag.
