Repl.it is becoming the platform where developers come to learn and
build. With [web hosting](hosting) we also made it possible to host websites and
since then we've seen an explosion of websites hosted on Repl.it. Today we're
going further by making it possible to deploy servers on Repl.it.

Just open a port, run your code, and that's it, it's deployed!

For our
[90s website competition](/ibuiltthis/websites) I built this socket.io-based
chat hosted on Repl.it:
[90s-chat--amasad.repl.co](https://90s-chat--amasad.repl.co/)

Here is the repl for it:

This is an early beta release so we look to your [feedback](/feedback) so we can improve it.
