Repl.it is a great place for prototyping ideas and starting new projects. However as your projects get bigger, the editing experience starts feeling a little limited. That's why we're exciting to announce that we're adding support for tabs!

With the new multitab layout, you can open files in new tabs so that you can quickly switch back to them later.

There are a few ways of opening a file in a new tab:
- `Ctrl + Click` (or `Cmd + Click` on MacOS) the file in the filetree
- Drag the file from the filetree directly onto the header or onto an open tab in the header
- Right click on the file and hit "Open tab" in the menu

From there, you can hit the "X" to the right of the file name to close the tab.

Here's a demo of what that looks like:

You can also drag tabs around to reorder them like so:

We hope this makes it easier to build larger projects on Repl.it. Happy hacking!
