The label "sessions" is very near and dear to my heart. I vividly remember how
Amjad came up with the name and why. After we learned that people would like to
create accounts on Repl.it, we were trying to figure out what was the main value
proposition for creating an account. Of course, it was saving code! But what do
you call a list of code projects saved on your account?

In a brainstorming session in the New York City subway (incidentally, on our way
to an improv class so naturally we were yes-anding each-other) Amjad suggested
the name "sessions"! He continued "this will be a feed of sesssions that you
create and manage".

But let's be honest "sessions" is kind of boring and somewhat bland. So if
Repl-it is about Repl-ing, what is the thing that you save? It's of course a
Repl! In fact, some of our users already call it that: "I made a repl". So going
forward we're going to use "Repl" instead of "Session".

When you log in you'll see that the "sessions" list is now a "Repls" list. And
an individual "session" is a "Repl". Not much else will change. But you'll be
happy to know that we're designing a place where you can showcase your Repls and
share them with the rest of our community.

Happy Repling!!
