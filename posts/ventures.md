### TL;DR

Replit Ventures will give a grant of $2000 each to 4 startups and 1 non-profit (in Bitcoin) with a chance for more funding later on. They will have additional help with tools, mentorship, networking, and further fundraising. You can apply [here](https://ventures.replit.com).

### What is Replit Ventures? 💸

At Replit, our mission is to make programming more accessible. Our platform removes friction that exists when building applications. This seamless development process has enabled entrepreneurs to create prototypes, MVPs, and even launch startups all in one place. We're proud to share that there are many ambitious startups that either started or running entirely on our platform (e.g., [Fig](https://withfig.com), [Blubbr](https://blubbr.io))- some generating thousands of dollars every month. Our users are building innovative products, and we want to help them grow.

Replit Ventures is our brand-new experimental startup incubator dedicated to bringing emerging startups and ideas to market. We want to invest our time and money into the next generation of entrepreneurs.

### Who qualifies? 👥

Everyone! It doesn't matter if you are in high school, college, or well into adulthood. All you have to do is [apply](https://ventures.replit.com). We will announce the first Replit Ventures Cohort on April 23rd.

### When does this start? 🚗

## FAQs 🤷🏻‍♂️

**Q: Who's running the program?**

Hi 👋🏻, I'm [Soren](https://twitter.com/roodsoren). I joined the team because I want to help other Replit entrepreneurs take their products to market. I'm one of the co-founders of [Blubbr](https://blog.replit.com/blubbr), a fellow Replit startup.
 
**Q: Do I have to give equity to Replit Ventures to participate in the incubator?**

You won't have to give up any equity since this is still an experimental program. As Replit Ventures grows and we feel it's adding a lot of value, we'll revisit this question.

**Q: Do I have to build my entire application in Replit?**

While it's strongly encouraged that your team does at least the prototyping in Replit, this is not required.

**Q: How many teams will be accepted for the first cohort?**

For the first cohort, we will accept 4 startups and 1 new nonprofit.

**Q: When is the application deadline?**

April 23 at 5PM PST!
