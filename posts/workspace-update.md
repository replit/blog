We strive to make the workspace as useful as possible while keeping it intuitive
and approachable. We get a crazy number of requests for features every day, not
to mention our own ideas. It becomes a challenging balance between feature creep
and simplicity. Lately we've added a few of these features that we hope you'll
find useful and, if not, you won't even notice they're there.

# Formatting in Javascript
Javascript is the first language where we've introduced an automatic formatter.
If you click the

  style="height: 24px; vertical-align:text-bottom; width: 21px; margin: 0 3px; display: inline-block;"
/>
icon we'll run your code through [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
which reprints your code in a consistent style.

We've already been using prettier internally since it first came out in and it
has been a huge win. We'll be rolling out formatters for other languages in the
future.

# Uploading Files
We now support upload any file off your computer and into the workspace. This
includes images which will be displayed as you'd expect. For example, you could
write a program which takes an image and turns it into a rotating gif. Then
upload an image of your choice, click run, and out pops the result:

(you can try it out for yourself [here](https://repl.it/Klxc/12))

# Downloading Files
If you've ever wanted to work on your repl outside of Replit, or take what
you've built and deploy it. Well now you can. Any file in your repl can be
downloaded on to your computer.

Uploading really wouldn't be complete without it.
