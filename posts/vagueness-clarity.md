Simple design is not only how the product looks like, but more importantly, how
the product functions; it’s about creating the easiest and simplest path for the
user to accomplish their goal. Usually, simple design comes from complex
requirements and a lot of ideas — in order to break it down I usually go through
a process that I call *Vagueness to Clarity*[](preview end).

This process requires a deep understanding of the problem to come up with the best
possible solution. Most people don’t pay attention to simple products because it
feels so right and intuitive when using them — it could be so frictionless to
the point that nothing gets in the way of accomplishing the main goal.

But simplicity is hard — it maybe counterintuitive that the cleaner the interface,
the more thoughts were put into it, and the longer it went through the Vagueness
to Clarity process.

## *From vague to complex*

People often ask me about the design process behind Repl.it and the most
interesting thing I can say about it is that I’m not myself a programmer. So I
spend a lot of time asking engineers questions, which seems like a never-ending
journey that begets even more questions.

When designing a new product the process starts with a vague idea of what it
should be, what type of user would use it, and what type of things they’d use it
for. The more you ask the what, how, and who the more answers and questions you
start to have. Eventually you’ll have a lot of information on the
subject — which leads to complexity.

## *Complexity is overwhelming and makes you feel lost*

Learning all this and having this knowledge can be overwhelming sometimes. Going
back to Repl.it, I overcome this complexity by jumping into prototyping,
suggesting solutions, and talking and brainstorming with engineers which helps
me understand the technical challenges. Having an understanding between
designers and engineers is key to overcoming complexity.

## *Time to clean, simplify and remove all the friction*

After going through the complexity phase now we need to simplify. This phase is
where I spend the majority of my time — reducing complexity and bringing the
idea back to solid roots.

Thinking like a beginner is required at this stage. Having gone through the
complexity phase, I have a lot of context on the subject but the user
wouldn’t — that’s why I need to keep a beginner’s mind.

Now, it’s all about removing friction and things that are not essential for the
user to reach their goals. It’s easier said than done so in a follow-up post
I’ll write about an example of this.

To summarize, here is what the entire process looks like:

Vagueness → Questions → Complexity → Overwhelmed and feeling lost → Finding
answers → Removing non-essentials → Simplicity → Better product and happier users :)
