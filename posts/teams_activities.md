You can do it, teachers! The end of the school year is in sight (at least for our North American friends ðŸ˜­)

Final exams are over, but you still need *something* to do with your students for the next few weeks. We've got you covered. 

Here are our top ~~five~~ six (because we couldn't choose just five) end of year project ideas that your kids will actually be excited about (and may continue doing on their own once school is out!) Isn't that every teacher's dream?

1. Did you know that Replit created a homegrown JavaScript game framework language, [kaboom.js](https://blog.replit.com/kaboom2000), that allows users to create 2D games. And we recently added [Kaboom Draw](https://blog.replit.com/kaboomdraw) too! Assign a project using kaboom.js and let your students get creative!

2. If you want to really go deep, you can import [this](https://replit.com/curriculum/Build-a-Video-Game-with-Kaboom) Kaboom curriculum into a team (don't forget, [teams are now FREE](https://blog.replit.com/teamsforedu_free)!). Students can learn about how objects move, gravity, and more all while making a video game.

3. Give your students a chance to show off their Python skills (and the power of Replit) by creating a [simple Python game](https://replit.com/curriculum/Build-a-Simple-Game-with-Python) with only a few lines of code. You can also use the new [search feature](https://blog.replit.com/search) to find more inspiration.

4. If you are looking for something focused on HTML/CSS/JavaScript, your students can create a [calculator](https://replit.com/@codewithharry/Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS#index.html). Their math teachers will thank you.

5. Need something to get their literacy juices flowing? This [wordle clone](https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT/wordle) by @CoderGautman will get their dictionaries on! Why stop there? Get them to fork and improve on it: on screen keyboards, fancier styling, a list of different words; remix as much as possible!

6. Extra credit project needed? Code an RPG game in less  than 3 minutes using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcoiEpzD3yc) tutorial (and of course, Kaboom.js)!
