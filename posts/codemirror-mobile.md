Today, we are thrilled to announce [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/6/) as the new code editor on Replit for mobile devices. CodeMirror is a versatile code editor that has been specifically designed with mobile in mind, providing an excellent touchscreen experience. This change is the beginning of a focused effort on mobile development here at Replit; the editor is just the first step! The editor supports all the features you expect from a code editor, and we're working on making it even more powerful.

We hope this update will be helpful for those of you who do not have access to a computer but still want to learn and create cool things. We are also working on bringing CodeMirror to the desktop to provide a consistent experience no matter what device you or your multiplayer partners are on. We will see many of the features that we currently have only on the desktop ported to mobile in the process. Keep an eye out for threads, debugger, and more on mobile.

Watch this blog for a follow-up technical post on our experience with the editors of the web: Monaco, Ace, and CodeMirror.

We've got a lot planned for mobile, we are so excited, and we hope you are too!
