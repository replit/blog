Arguments over programming language semantics, standard library behavior, or
syntax can now be simply and immediately settled within the chatroom by talking
to Evalbot. It is a bot that can speak over 10 programming languages and is
ever-present on Messenger and can be added to your team chat on Slack.[](preview end)

*Evalbot: a bot that speaks code*

Beyond settling arguments we envision Evalbot to be useful for teaching and
learning programming in chatrooms and for quickly running programs in Messenger
on the go. That, and it's just a fun hack that we enjoyed working on :)

Evalbot can be interacted with in a couple of ways:

- Named code fences are parsed and executed

- Conversational

To get started, [add evalbot to your slack team](https://evalbot-slack.now.sh/login)
or [message it on facebook](https://m.me/repl.it). You can visit the
[help page](https://repl.it/site/evalbot) for more info.

We built Evalbot using our [API](/site/api) and put the code on
[Github](https://github.com/replit/evalbot). Let us know on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/replit) how you're using Evalbot. Beep Bop.
