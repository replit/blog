Today we're super excited to announce the launch of one of our
most requested features to date.

For almost as long as Replit has been around, people in the community
have been asking for a way to create and share their very own Custom Themes!
Well now you can.

With Custom Themes, you can truly make Replit yours by styling everything
from the app's colors, both in the IDE and across the site, to the syntax highlighting
in your code.

## Create

To get started, simply visit the themes section under your 
[account page](https://replit.com/account#themes) and hit
"Create Theme". From there, give your new theme a title, add a description,
and select a color scheme (light or dark).

Once your theme is created, you'll be dropped into the Themes Editor.
In the Themes Editor, you can change the global tokens, which include
the background, foreground, primary, and outline colors that you'll see
throughout the entire site.

Just below that is the syntax higlighting editor where you can configure
how various tokens appear in your code. These will apply in the IDE 
as well as everywhere else you might see a code editor.
With custom syntax highlighting, you can change the look and feel of everything
from variable names and language-specific keywords to literals like strings and numbers!

You'll also be able to preview the changes you make to the theme live right in
the editor to get a feel for how it'll look the next time you're coding!
The preview editor contains some example code and features many of 
our most popular languages including JavaScript, Python, and Java.

Updates to the theme will be auto-saved for you as you tweak its values so
you'll never have to worry about losing any of the changes you've made.

Watch the entire flow in action here:

Once you're done creating your theme, you can publish it to the Community!
Don't worry if your theme isn't perfect yet - you can always publish updates
if you decide to make any changes in the future.

To learn more about how to create and publish your very own Custom Theme,
take a look at [our docs](https://docs.replit.com/category/themes)!

## Explore

If _making_ themes isn't your thing, you can also browse and install
existing themes from the Community on the [Explore Page](https://replit.com/themes).

From the Themes Explore Page, you can see the
most popular themes that others in the community have 
created and published.

If you're looking for something specific, you can also filter themes by
title, author, color scheme (light or dark), and even specific hex codes like so:

Once you've found a theme you really like, you can click on its card to navigate
to its Cover Page. On the Cover Page, you can preview, share, and install
a theme! If you're really happy with what they've made, you can even leave
the creator [a tip in Cycles](https://docs.replit.com/cycles/tipping)!

Any themes that you've created and installed will appear under your account page,
alongside the existing official themes, so that you can easily switch between
them at any time!

If you need some inspiration to help you get started, take a look at
some of the popular existing themes that people in our community
have recreated such as [Dracula](https://replit.com/theme/@TG101/dracula),
[Nord](https://replit.com/theme/@ReplitIronclad/nord),
[Gruvbox](https://replit.com/theme/@replitjeremy/gruvbox),
[Atom One Dark](https://replit.com/theme/@ErikoXDev/atom-one-dark),
[Tanne](https://replit.com/theme/@CodingCactus/tanne),
[Solarized](https://replit.com/theme/@UMARismyname/solarized-11a11c10), and more.

We hope that you enjoy using Custom Themes on Replit and are super 
excited to see what you create. Happy theming!
