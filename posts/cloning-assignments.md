You can now copy and clone an assignment from one classroom to another!  Many teachers have requested this feature, and we are happy to announce that it has been released!

Read on to see it in action.

Cloned assignments will carry over the code, files, instructions, automatic test cases, and model solutions.  The newly cloned assignment will appear in your destination classroom as a draft.

You can find the option for cloning an assignment by clicking on the three dots next to an assignment:

A list of valid destination classrooms (including the one you are currently in) will appear.  This means that you can use this functionality to duplicate an assignment within a classroom.  You can only clone assignments into a classroom of the same programming language.

You should now be able to see the assignment under "Drafts" in the chosen classroom!
