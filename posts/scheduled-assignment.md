Today, we're introducing scheduled assignments. Teachers using [Repl.it
Classroom](/classrooms) can now schedule
assignments to be published in the future. You can imagine working on your
assignment, schedule a publish date, go on vacation, and still have your
students receive their assignments at the right time.[](preview end)

When the assignment is finally published your students will receive a
notification informing them of it.

You can get to this menu from the second page in the assignment creation flow. As
always, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:contact@repl.it">contact@repl.it</a>
with feedback. We'd love to hear about how this feature helped you. Or,
more importantly, if there is something we can be doing better.
