When you're deep into a debugging session printing a bunch of `here`, `there`, and `wat`, the output in the terminal can get hard to read. That's when search comes in handy, and that's why we're excited to announce our new terminal search functionality. 

You can get to it via the small search icon on the top-right corner of the terminal:

And here it is in real-life action from one of a recent debugging session:

Hope you find it useful!
