Our [Hacker plan](https://replit.com/site/pricing) has always been a great choice if you need more powerful repls. In addition to benefits like private repls, more storage, and [always on](https://blog.replit.com/alwayson), the Hacker plan gives all of your repls 4x the CPU and RAM compared to those in our free plan.

However, sometimes, even 4x is not enough. Whether you're building a [new Terminal](https://blog.replit.com/fig) or [playing Doom](https://blog.replit.com/native-graphics-love), you could blow past those resource limits pretty quickly. That's why today we're excited to announce Boosts!

Boosts are a new addition to our Hacker plan that allow you to make your repls even faster. Boosted repls come with 4 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM which is double the resources of standard Hacker repls (and 8x more than free repls). As of today, we're including 5 free boosts as part of the Hacker plan. However, boosts can also be purchased on a free plan using [Cycles](https://replit.com/cycles).

To boost your repl, simply click on your repl's title to bring up the repl info card and click the "Add boost" button underneath the always on toggle like so:

You'll notice the difference immediately if you're running a graphics or CPU intensive repl like this:

Hacker initially provides 5 free boosts but you can go beyond this 5 repl limit and add boosts to a free plan account with [Cycles](https://replit.com/cycles).

Eventually, you'll even be able to choose from a number of machines with arbitrarily high resource limits.

We hope this makes it easier to build faster and more complex apps on Replit. Happy hacking!
