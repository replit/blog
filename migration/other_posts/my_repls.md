People use Repl.it in a variety of ways; some use it for building and shipping
applications, while others use it for working on homework, and many others use
it as a quick prototyping/experimentation tool. Supporting all these use cases
(and more) is something we care a lot about, but up until now there wasn't an
easy way to, for example, quickly go back to a project that you continue to work
on every day.

Today we're excited to announce some of the changes that we've
been testing for the past couple of weeks. Going to ["my repls"](https://repl.it/repls) the
first thing you'll notice is a big "Continue coding" section with the projects
that we think you might want to go back and work on.

## Starring

Additionally, you can now star repls, so it's easy to go back to them!

## Quick repl creation

Repl.it users usually code in 1-3 languages, but up until now you had to go to
the full list of languages every time you wanted to create a new repl.
For that, we've added a button that expands to include your three top-most used
languages.

## Infinite load

Paging can be clunky and slow; it's much easier just to scroll.

## Conclusion

We're not done yet; there's a lot more left to be desired. Look out for a new
and improved search bar. But for now, if you have any feedback, we'd love to
[hear it](https://repl.it/feedback)!
