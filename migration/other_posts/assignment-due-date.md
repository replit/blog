On Wednesday we announced [assignment scheduling](https://repl.it/site/blog/scheduled-assignment), and today we're releasing another date related feature—due dates. It's no secret that students can procrastinate, so sometimes it's useful to have deadlines for the assignments as a reminder.[](preview end)

Due date restricts students from submitting after a certain date/time. If you're feeling generous and want to give students another shot, just edit the assignment and update the due date.

As you can see in the image above, we had to swap a couple of things to fit this in. We moved the assignment name to the header—which you can edit, and placed the due date above the instructions.
