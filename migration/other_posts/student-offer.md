We believe everyone should have instant access to a complete coding environment in their browser. Thatâ€™s why Repl.it has joined the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub Student Developer Pack</a>, giving eligible students free access to private repls and unlimited multiplayer sessions. Students can now focus on learning and collaborating with their classmates in new ways, without the hassle of setting up a new environment each time.

## How To Claim Private Repls for Free
To claim the Private Repls, eligible students should apply for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) and then [log in to Repl.it using their GitHub credentials](https://repl.it/login). All eligible accounts will automatically have access to Private Repls for free of charge for 6 months.

## Unlimited Multiplayer Sessions
Repl.it allows students to write code together in their browsers, unlocking a whole new way to work together on assignments and projects. Students can code together in real time or asynchronously, study group can take on a whole new meaning.
