Terminals make it hard to copy things: Selecting text works differently to what people are used to, and `^C` aborts the current program. Links are hard to use.

Now you can click on links in the repl.it terminal.

![An example of links in terminal being clickable](https://blog.replit.com/images/terminal-links/terminal-links-intro.png)

It's as simple as starting a repl and printing a URL to the terminal.

This is super helpful with languages like Rust, which often print URLs in error messages to help you debug and learn.

This also works on repl.run, where you can [publish terminal apps as websites](https://repl.it/talk/announcements/BetaExplorers-Announcing-replrun-publish-your-terminal-apps-as-websites/7802). As an example, here's the repl.it blog available on repl.run [as a terminal website](https://terminalblog.arnavbansal.repl.run/), written in python:

<iframe src="https://terminalblog.arnavbansal.repl.run/" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="terminalblog" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="600px" width="100%" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Now your terminal apps can link to anything on the web!
