Template Jam is Replit's annual template contest where our community builds repls that help themselves and others build projects on top of. These templates range widely from new language support, framework starter kits, to beginner guides.

This year, from May 23rd to June 23rd, we collected over 350 submissions from template creators. And today we're announcing the winners of the first $5,000 up for grabs!

Phase 1 winners were selected by a group of judges comprised of Replit's own engineers and one esteemed guest judge, [Irene Alverado](https://twitter.com/ire_alva). The winners of the next $5,000 will be decided by how popular your template is with the community and we'll announce them in a couple weeks!

But without further ado...

## Grand Prize - $1,400 USD

### [CodeMirror 6](https://replit.com/@CodingCactus/Codemirror-6)

This year, a Replit community mainstay, [Coding Cactus](https://replit.com/@CodingCactus) takes home the grand prize with a template allowing almost anyone to create their own online code editor. This in-depth template gives you everything you need to create extensions and add new language support for existing CodeMirror 6 projects, like [Replit](https://blog.replit.com/codemirror).

This template showcases how you can add syntax highlighting and autocomplete to CodeMirror, using a custom language that the creator came up with themself! And in Coding Cactus's own words, they wrote docs "that anyone can follow to create the editor of their dreams ðŸ¥³."

## Second Prize - $250 USD each

For second prize, we are selecting three templates that both amaze us and serve to advance the capabilities of Replit creators. We're in awe of the quality of the code and the documentation that all of these templates show.

### [Advanced P5.js Platformer Engine](https://replit.com/@IroncladDev/Advanced-P5js-Platformer-Engine)

Attention game devs! Another long-time community member, [IroncladDev](https://replit.com/@IroncladDev) has come through with an incredibly advanced platformer engine template.
