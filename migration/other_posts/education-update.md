Hey teachers! Back to school is here and we've got an update on our education products and pricing.

If you haven't already heard, we've just released a new [Teams for Education product](https://repl.it/teams), which is is the easiest way to teach and learn programming online, on any device, with no setup ([read our original blog post for more details](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education)).

It goes without saying, but it's a crazy time we're all living through. Things are changing fast, and we at Repl.it want to do our part to support everyone who's learning or teaching Computer Science right now. We recognize for many schools and universities that this year's budget has already been allocated and it may be difficult to find the resources to pay for an account.

So if you are unable to find budget, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/CNELwJDDVabKtpdp7), and **we will set you up with a free Teams for Education account for the fall semester.**

If you are able to find last minute budget and plan to use Repl.it, please sign up and [create a paid account here](https://repl.it/teams). We appreciate your commitment and support! (There will likely be perks, grandfathered lower pricing in the future, etc. if you do.)

If you have legacy materials in Classroom (or old education product) and still need access, after you've created a team, just email us at contact@repl.it and we can turn on access. Classroom will be replaced by Teams for Education in the future, so all new teachers should be using Teams.

Also just a reminder that we only collect students' and teachers' email addresses and do not collect other personal information. We never share that information with 3rd parties and only use it to send communications directly related to Repl.it. You can [read more here](https://repl.it/site/privacy). If there are any concerns, you and your students are also welcome to use the site freely and anonymously, without creating an account or sharing any information. Just [go here](https://repl.it/languages) and choose the language you'd like to program in. You won't be able to save your work to your account, use multiplayer, or create/submit assignments, but you can still code in the browser with no setup!

And check out the new [tutorials](https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/00-overview) and free [HTML/CSS](https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introHTMLCSS) and [Python](https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introPython) curricula (including assignments in Repl.it) that we've just released. This is a great way to get started with Repl.it for your students! 

Lastly, as you are using Repl.it this fall, please send any feedback to contact@repl.it or [post here](https://replit.canny.io/feedback/p/teams-education-beta-feedback). We'd love to hear from you!
