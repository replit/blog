Earlier this week we introduced [Haskell support](haskell). And now, as promised,
we're continuing to add more functional languages. So today we're excited to introduce
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/). A Lisp dialect that runs on top of the Java
Virtual Machine with a focus on immutability. [](preview end)

You can give it a try right now at
[repl.it/languages/clojure](https://repl.it/languages/clojure). And as always
here's a gif of what you can expect:

This is built on top of the Clojure's
[NRepl](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) server so you should be able to
get the native behavior you expect from a Clojure REPL. Please let us know if we
can make it better.
