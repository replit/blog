**Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access [here](https://replit.com/teams-for-education).*

Hello teachers, we hope your new year is off to a good start and your students have come back from the holidays engaged and excited to learn programming! If you've been teaching with Replit for awhile, you know how committed we are to helping teachers create aha moments and inspire their students. To that end we've been working hard to make Teams for Education the best CS education tool out there and want to share some updates.

After January 31st, we will end access to our legacy Classroom product. If you haven't tried [Teams for Education](https://repl.it/teams) yet, now's the time! Teams for education is [FERPA/COPPA and privacy compliant](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/privacyFAQs) and has [assignments](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Projects), [autograding](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/InputOutput) and other Classroom features you love, plus [real-time multiplayer collaboration](https://repl.it/site/multiplayer), [code conversations/annotations](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Annotations), and more. [Migrate your Classroom now for free.](https://repl.it/classroom-migration) (Note: you'll still be able to migrate/export your data after January 31st.)

We will be hosting several webinars over the next few weeks to provide basic training on the product and answer any of your questions. Here's a [recording of our last webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUX-dkHWU8A) in case you missed it. We'd love to see you there!
