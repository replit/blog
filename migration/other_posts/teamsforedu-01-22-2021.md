**Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is now free to all educators. You can gain access [here](https://replit.com/teams-for-education).*

Hello teachers, we hope you're enjoying the new features we've been adding  to Teams for Education! At Repl.it we are dedicated to empowering teachers and want to be the first tool you turn to when you're inspiring the next generation of engineers and builders.

*First a quick reminder: we are ending access to the legacy Classroom product after January 31st. You can [migrate your classroom](https://repl.it/classroom-migration) anytime to a free trial of [Teams for Education](https://repl.it/teams), our new and improved product for teachers and students. Teams is [FERPA/COPPA and privacy compliant](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/privacyFAQs) and offers new tools such as [real-time multiplayer collaboration](https://repl.it/site/multiplayer), [auto-grading](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/InputOutput) and [code conversations](https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Annotations) that will take your teaching to a new level.*

This week we're excited to announce...

### Project Sharing!

Teachers can now bulk copy and share projects to any Team. This feature is useful for a single teacher managing multiple classes or sharing curriculum with your colleagues. Sharing and bulk copying is managed using a secure private link that is created by the team admin. We hope this will save you a lot of time.
