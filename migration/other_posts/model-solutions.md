There is a special moment in learning: when a student runs their code against
the unit tests and finally sees all of them turn green. This moment of
enlightenment means the student has just managed to create their own working
solution to a difficult problem, and has made a step towards becoming a great
programmer! Wouldn't it be cool to further enhance the student's knowledge by
showing the student different approaches to tackle the same problem?

We are excited to introduce model solutions. Model solutions allow you show your
students the best way to complete an assignment after they have come to their
own working solution. Students will have access to your model solution once they
submit their own and it is marked as completed. Model solutions can help you as
a teacher demonstrate a preferred coding style, new language features and
idioms, or simpler and more efficient algorithms.

Model solutions can also help teachers debug unit tests. A teacher can create
their assignments via TDD (test driven development) by writing the tests first
and then creating a solution to pass them. Switching between the unit test
editor and model solution editor is a seamless way to make sure the unit tests
are bullet proof.

For now, model solutions can only be added to assignments with unit tests. If
you'd like to use them for a use case that we don't currently support, don't

enhance your classrooms and work towards universal programming literacy.
