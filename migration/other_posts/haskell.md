We heard your requests for Haskell and today we're excited to finally announce
Haskell as yet another language we support. We've decided to put our focus on
adding more functional languages, starting with Haskell, so you can expect more
very soon.[](preview end)

Right now, the Haskell repl has few limitations. In the repl, `stdout` won't be
echoed until your program completes execution, and `stdin` is completely ignored.
So if you want to use something like `getLine`, it's probably best to put that
in the editor. Aside from that, it should behave eactly like
[ghci](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/).

You can give it a try right now at
[repl.it/languages/haskell](https://repl.it/languages/haskell). Let us know what you think.

And as always here's a gif of what you can expect:
