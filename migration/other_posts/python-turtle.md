Ever since the [LOGO programming
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language) educators
have been using [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)
to demonstrate the power of programming to their students while making it fun and
interesting.[](preview end)

In fact, my first real programming experience was when I was 6 years old
learning LOGO at school. I learned how to program the turtle to draw a square
and a triangle which I then put together to create a house. However, I was frustrated
that I had to keep repeating the code to create a village made from
multiple houses -- and that's how discovered loops! It's a natural way for
children to learn programming. Here is an [example turtle graphic house](https://repl.it/DoYJ/1) in
repl.it :)

So far, we've been focused on what we think was largely missing from the web:
running programs that typically require installing a compiler or an interpreter
on your computer. However, now that we've
built [tools](https://repl.it/classroom) for teachers to bring programming to
their classroom, many want to use turtle graphics as part of their
cirriculum. And that's why we're excited to introduce [Turtle Graphics](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html)
support for Python.

To get started just select [`Python (with Turtle)`](https://repl.it/languages/python_turtle) from the list of languages,
import the `turtle` module and start drawing!

_The Python Turtle implementation is powered by the [Skulpt open source project](http://skulpt.org)._
