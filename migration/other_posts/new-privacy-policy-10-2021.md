Today we're excited to announce that anyone can [embed repls](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/embedding-repls) on their site, in their app, or as part of their business, including for commercial use. This update is reflected in our [terms and conditions](https://replit.com/site/terms). We can't wait to see what you all build.

We're also excited to sign the [Student Privacy Pledge](https://studentprivacypledge.org/), joining hundreds of businesses committed to protecting students and their data. This update is reflected in our [existing privacy policy](https://replit.com/site/privacy) and our [new student privacy policy](https://replit.com/site/studentprivacy). We believe teachers and students deserve the best and safest tools.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at privacy@repl.it. [Happy coding](https://repl.new/)!
