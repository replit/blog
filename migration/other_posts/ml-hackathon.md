We’re extremely excited to announce Replit’s very first Machine Learning Hackathon, in partnership with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)! If you’re interested in joining the waitlist, head over to the [official site](https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/).

      <a class="cta-btn" href="https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/" target="_blank">Sign up for the Waitlist</a>
</div>

Weights and Biases is a machine learning platform that tracks everything you need to make your models reproducible – from hyperparameters and code to model weights and dataset versions. If you’ve never worked with W&B, check out this [example Repl](https://replit.com/@wandb) for an introduction!

The total prize pool is over 500,000 Cycles – there are multiple opportunities to win, with prizes for [Best Weights & Biases Report](https://wandb.ai/wandb/intro/reports/Some-of-our-Favorite-Reports--VmlldzozMTAzNjQ3), Best Repl, an Honorable Mention, and of course, the Grand Prize of 300,000 cycles. 


## How do I participate?

To start off, you’ll need to register for the waitlist which you can do [here](https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/). If selected to participate, you’ll receive an email with all of the details, including access to GPUs and a [Cycles](https://docs.replit.com/cycles/about-cycles) stipend to power your project. Teams and individuals over the age of 13 are eligible to enter, and one entry per person/team is permitted. You’ll need a Replit account, as well as a [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) account, to participate. 

The Machine Learning Hackathon will take place from February 4th to 11th, 2023. On February 4th, join us for the [live opening ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/4-yfJgKyCp4?feature=share) where we’ll work through a tutorial, announce the prizes, and review the rules for submission!

To submit your project, you’ll return to the [site](https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/) and use the submission form, making sure to select which prizes you wish to compete for! To be eligible for the Best Replit Project prize, you’ll also need to [publish your work](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/sharing-your-repl) to [Community](https://replit.com/community/all) with the #wandb tag. All projects must be submitted by 11:59PM PST on February 11, 2023.

When the hackathon ends and all projects are submitted, the judges have 4 days to choose the winners. The judges will be choosing the winners based on the prize categories listed on the [site](https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/). Be sure to tune in to our [closing ceremony livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BP4J1Gno2A) on YouTube on February 15th to hear us announce the winners live!


## Resources to Get Started 

If you’re just getting started with your machine learning journey, not to worry – we’ve got plenty of resources to get you setting up your models and making discoveries in no time. 

We're also hosting Weights & Biases CEO [Lukas Biewald](https://twitter.com/l2k) and our very own [Amjad Masad](https://twitter.com/amasad) for a fireside chat on the future of ML on January 18th, where we'll show off what you can do when you combine the power of W&B and Replit. Join us [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFsj9V6-1NE) or watch on-demand anytime on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@replit).
