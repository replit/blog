Today we're excited to release a feature which shows any files your program
creates directly inside the REPL. And any time that file changes it will be
updated live in the editor. This can be anything from a text file to a gif.

We also added support for [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) in python3 so you
can make pretty graphs and watch them update live.

Like [this](https://repl.it/EwS1): ![file updates](http://i.imgur.com/aQ6S00P.gif)

And we don't stop you from rewriting your own source file so you can write a
program which modifies itself, like this [counting quine](https://repl.it/EwQx).
