Today Ghostwriter comes with four AI features:
1. **[Complete Code](https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/complete-code)** - Ghostwriter's flagship feature, providing in-line code suggestions as you type.
2. **[Explain Code](https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/explain-code)** - Highlight any block of code you want explained, and Ghostwriter will walk through it step-by-step in plain English.
4. **[Transform Code](https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/transform-code)** - Take a piece of code, describe changes you want to make to it, and Ghostwriter will re-write it with the changes you wanted.
5. **[Generate Code](https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/generate-code)** - Tell Ghostwriter what functions or program you want written and let Ghostwriter generate code to help solve your problem.

Combining these four features, you have paranormal powers at your fingertips:
- **Automate repetitive boilerplate code** like function and file generation.
- **Quickly transform and refactor** large code blocks.
- **Learn faster and get unstuck** while learning new skills.
- **Creatively express yourself** by prompting Ghostwriter in plain English to write code for you.

Seeing is believing. Let us show you what Ghostwriter can do for you.

## Ghostwriter is your pair programmer
Bring your ideas to life quicker with Ghostwriter's help. Ghostwriter uses code and comment context to help reduce friction, so you can do what you do best... create!

It's almost like Ghostwriter knows what you are thinking...

With a little more guidance, Ghostwriter can even take tasks off your hands. Need to adjust or refactor? Don't waste time doing it yourself... just highlight the code, and ask Ghostwriter. 

<style>
  .video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;

## Ghostwriter is your creative consultant

Traverse dimensions and interact directly with the computer. Give Ghostwriter natural language prompts, and watch Ghostwriter represent your ideas with code.

<style>
  .video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;

Cycling through the code suggestions can help stimulate ideas on what to build!

## Ghostwriter is your trusted tutor

Traditional online learning: You start coding. You get stuck. Then what?

Ghostwriter is there to help you learn. With Ghostwriter (and [100 Days of Code!](https://blog.replit.com/100-days-of-code)) learning to code has never been easier!

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;

Maybe it's from your lesson plan, or maybe it is something you wrote weeks ago. Either way, you may look at a few lines of code and think... what does that mean?

Ask Ghostwriter to give you a step-by-step explanation of the code.

<style>
  .video-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
}

.video-container iframe {
  position: absolute;

Or simply just ask Ghostwriter to help you get started with Generate Code.

## Team Shoutouts!
This was a major team effort:
- Alex and Giuseppe built Complete Code
- Jonathan and Krish built Generate Code and Transform Code
- Jonathan and Arnav built Explain Code
- Muhammad and Samip worked on the AI model backing Complete Code
  
When we launch a new product line like Ghostwriter, it takes more than just engineers building the feature itself: Jonathan, Ted, Devin, Aman, and Søren built out the onboarding experience and purchase flow you’ll go through, as well as the Ghostwriter webpage.
