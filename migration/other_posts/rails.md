Philosophically, Replit and Rails are incredibly aligned. We both exist to remove excessive configuration and complexity that stands in the way of building things. However, for a long time, it bothered me that Replit didn't work well with Rails because we focus on small and lightweight projects. Recently, our infrastructure has gotten much more powerful, and I decided to give Rails another spin. It turns out it's not only possible to do Rails on Replit; it's quite a delightful experience. It takes less than 30 seconds from starting a project to seeing the welcome screen:

<video controls webkit-playsinline="true" playsinline="" src="https://blog.replit.com/images/rails/rails.mp4"></video>

There is no magic under the hood. You can view the [template here](https://repl.it/@templates/Rails). I merely followed the getting started guide on the rails site and had to do only a couple of modifications to make the development website show up in the iframe on Replit (detailed in the readme file).

Give it a spin, and let me know what you think!
