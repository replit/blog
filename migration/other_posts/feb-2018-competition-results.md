As we released [I Built This](https://repl.it/ibuiltthis/), our community where users can post about their repl creations, we were exposed to many amazing projects created by our users.  To kick it off, we hosted a competition where users post their work and garner upvotes for prizes.  The projects shared in the competition spanned a wide range of skill levels, from beginner to advanced, from simple to complex.

The competition was fierce, with several programs leading the first few days neck-to-neck - competitors recruited the help of their classmates, friends, peers, and even members of the Repl.it community to help their project.

But users weren't finished once they posted their project.  Members of the community came together to share possible features that could enhance the project, as well as efficiency tips and good old fashioned debugging.  Many users kept working on their projects throughout the course of the competition.

At the conclusion of the competition, on Feb 20th 2018, the winners emerged:
* 1st Place: [@CyanCoding](https://repl.it/@CyanCoding), with his [Brute Force Password Cracker](https://repl.it/@CyanCoding/Brute-Force-Password-Cracker)
* 2nd Place: [@QuadeG1](https://repl.it/@QuadeG1), who built a [Dice Roller](https://repl.it/@QuadeG1/Dice-Roller)
* 3rd Place: [@davidpython3](https://repl.it/@davidpython3), recreating [Rock Paper Scissors](https://repl.it/ibuiltthis/p/rock-paper-scissors-again-d)

In addition, there was one project that stood out as a particularly unique repl, and that was none other than a working [Chatroom](https://repl.it/@pyelias/Chatroom) by [@pyelias](https://repl.it/@pyelias), who won the **Staff Pick** award.

We were able to interview the winners, and we would like to share their story with you.

**Congratulations on winning!  Tell us a bit about yourself!**

> CyanCoding: I am Camden, and I'm 13 and 1/2. I'm currently in 8th grade. In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends and play on my New 2ds XL.

> Quade: I'm 15 and I'm a sophomore - I enjoy playing chess and programming!

> david: I'm 14 years old. I come from Romania but one year ago I moved with my family here in Germany and I started to learn german. I'm in the 8th grade.  I usually enjoy to watch videos on youtube, to play games or.. to program. Python is my first programming language.

> pyelias: I’m 12, and in 7th grade. My hobbies are mostly just programming.

**How did you get into programming?**

> Camden: I got into programming in June of 2016 during summer break. My co-op was holding a class learning ProcessingJS. I was one of the few that actually found it very fascinating.  Then, I decided to actually learn [python]. From there, I basically learned 10 more languages just to see what my favorites are (C++, Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery).

> Quade: I started programming by using block code on code.org I quickly realized that I had the mind of a programmer I was able to fly through the website with ease, and after that started to experiment with python! 

> david: I liked to play games and I saw that in every game is always something that I didn't like and I wanted to create my own game so.. I started to program.

> pyelias: I got bored when I was around 8 years old, and decided to find out what programming was.

**What was the inspiration for your creation?**

> Camden: The inspiration for this project was that I heard about a Brute Force Password Cracker on Stackoverflow when I was looking over answers. I looked it up (BFPC in general sounds pretty cool, so I was already sold) and I started researching how these work. Then I took a huge step and started planning working out an idea and running tests.

> Quade: Originally it was an assignment from my teacher but as I got feedback I made it much better than it was!

> david: From this guy : CleverProgrammer [on Youtube], I saw  that he had a project called "Rock, Paper or Scissors" , but I couldn't understand very good how he explained it so I started to make my own "Rock, Paper , Scissors" game.

> pyelias: I had just made a database, and I wanted to do something cool with it.

**What are your next steps for this project?**

> Camden: My next steps for this project, is to leave it. I tampered with it for a few days after release, and even when I got ideas from this competition. I completed a BFPC in C++ (I had been working on it on/off for about a month) on Saturday night that actually runs about nine times faster (and it gets smarter as it goes!).

> Quade: I'm not sure I'm going to take this any farther I feel like I've done enough and that it's time to move on to bigger things! Next year I'm going to take a class for mobile app development and hopefully get an app on the market!

> david: Now, I've bought a programming book and I look at another guy on the internet that makes lessons for Python, and I always look at him. I try to finish this book and his lessons.

> pyelias: I’ll probably just keep adding features to this, and maybe do a rework at some point.

It was a pleasure seeing everyone's creativity and hard work in the form of awesome and innovative repls.  We at Repl.it are glad to be hosting the next generation of hackers and tinkerers.  Keep on coding, and keep an eye out for our future competitions!
