Today, we're excited to announce that we're [granting $100,000](http://freecodecamp.org/news/announcing-rust-course-replit-web) to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to fund new interactive programming courses in Rust and Python web development (with Flask + [replit.web](https://blog.replit.com/replit-web)) and to partially fund their upcoming [Data Science curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/). 

Like Replit, the team at freeCodeCamp is committed to making programming fun and accessible to anyone, anywhere with an internet connection. Currently they're reaching millions of learners every month, have helped 40,000+ get jobs as software engineers, and have an [active and supportive community](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/). We're honored to continue our years-long support of such an incredible organization!

We will post links here to the new materials in the coming months. In the meantime, check out some of these freeCodeCamp tutorials that use Replit:
