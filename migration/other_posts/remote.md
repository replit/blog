**Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access [here](https://replit.com/teams-for-education).*

We've been hearing from our teacher community that despite school closings they want to continue teaching their students remotely. Luckily Repl.it was designed to be remote-first and will be a perfect tool for this.  We have two products that serve different remote modes:

### [Multiplayer](https://repl.it/site/multiplayer)

Real-time collaboration. You can invite your entire class into a repl to follow along or even collaborate all together. To that end, we're increasing the number of free collaborators on the free plan to 50 users!

### [Classroom](https://repl.it/site/classrooms)

Create small programming tasks for your students, give them feedback, and track their progress.
