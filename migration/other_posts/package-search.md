We recently made it possible to [import](python-import) any package from
PyPi. However, people who missed the announcement didn't know this was
possible. There was also no good way to search and explore packages.

That's why today we're excited to introduce a package search widget.
You'll be able to search for any python package without leaving the programming
environment.
