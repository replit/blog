Some changes and fixes we make don't deserve their own blogpost. So we thought a
good way to keep you up-to-date is to collect however many that could be of
interest and write a ["Changelog"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog).

## IDE Changes

### ES2015 imports from npm

A couple of months ago we [announced](npm) that you can `require` any package
from npm. But some of you have moved past the archaic ways of CommonJS and
wanted support for ES6. So that's why we're glad to bring ES6 import
support. Check [this](/IYQ3) out.

### Python turtle keyboard support

So you want to move your turtle? We got you. Check [this](/IYQ8) out.

### Bigger Python turtle canvas

It's much hard to run out of space; you can scroll around or expand your screen
to see what your turtle did.

## Classroom changes

### Monospace in instructions

For inline code notice that you can now style your words with "monospace" in our
classroom instructions editor.

### Change assignment "scheduled at"

You couldn't change your assignment publish date unless you unpublish. Now you
can do that.
