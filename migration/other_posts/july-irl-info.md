For the month of July, our Repl.it IRL will be taking place on July 11th from 4 to 7 PM at the [Bradfield School of Computer Science](https://goo.gl/maps/CQpvexqXKbn)!

We'll be having pizza and awesome people as always and, for this IRL, we will be starting with a show and tell session. For show and tell, people come up and present a project, whether it's a project they're working on or a cool open source project they like.

Once people who wanted to present have presented, we'll move into a mini hackathon with a given prompt (last time the prompt was to make an over complicated "Hello World" program) and spend the last portion of the IRL presenting people's progress and projects!

If you're interested in attending, fill out the RSVP form at
