Ever since we introduced third-party package support for Python we've seen an
explosion of exciting programs on Repl.it. Everything from games to
machine-learning applications that just weren't possible before.

Today we're happy to announce that we're expanding this to support
Node.js. Just `require` your dependencies and we'll handle the rest for you.
Here is a working repl that gets my Github stats. It uses `request` to
fetch the data and `underscore` to filter the relevant stats.

This is an early (open beta) release so please let us know if you hit any bugs
or issues. We're currently working on the following:

- package.json support: if you have a `package.json` in your project we'll use
that instead of parsing the requires. This will likely come in the next couple of
days.
- Caching: if you install a package on a repl it will be cached forever.
- Global caching: if you or someone else on Repl.it installs a package we'll
centrally cache it to make subsequent installs faster.
