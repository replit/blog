We are stoked to announce Kajam 2022 - Replit's second annual game jam! If you're interested in registering head right on over to the official [Kajam site](https://kajam.replit.com/). 

This year, we're leveling everything up - including the prizes. The total prize pool is over $35,000 and will be split up amongst 7 different prizes. Kajam registrants will have 7 days to hack together the best dang game they can dream up.


## How do I participate?

To start off, you'll need to register for Kajam which you can do [here](https://kajam.replit.com/). Kajam will officially take place from June 25th to July 2nd.  Once you're done with the final touches on your game, you'll need to make sure it's submitted.

To submit your game, you'll need to do two things. First, post the repl of your game to replit.com/community with the hashtag #Kajam2022. Once posted, you'll also need to submit your game through the submission form on the official [jam site](https://kajam.replit.com/). Your game must be submitted by 11:59 PM PST on July 2, 2022. 

When the hackathon ends and all games are submitted, we'll give the judges 3 days to choose winners. The judges will be choosing winners based on the prize categories listed on the [jam site](https://kajam.replit.com/). Be sure to tune in to our closing ceremony livestream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/replityt) on July 9 to hear us announce the winners live!
