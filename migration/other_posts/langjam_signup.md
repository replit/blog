You can now register your team to enter the [programming language jam](https://repl.it/jam)! In addition to setting up your team you can start brainstorming ideas, but we ask you to wait until the 10th before you start hacking. 

If you don't have a team, join our [Discord](https://repl.it/discord) and we'll help you find one. 

Please follow these steps to register your team:

## Sign up for Repl.it

If you're not signed up yet, please do that first. It's free and can be done in a couple of minutes. [Sign up](https://repl.it/signup).

## Enter the jam

Now that you have a team we need to enter it into the jam. For this we're going to use our command-line (see [CLUI](clui) for more info): [https://repl.it/~/cli](https://repl.it/~/cli)
