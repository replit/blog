People in our community build awesome games, apps, and websites on Repl.it's web
programming environment, but until now they didn't have any easy way of sharing
these creations with other people.

But today we're fixing this: every web program you write we will automatically
host for you under a subdomain with your name. You're then free to share the
website, make it your homepage, submit it as homework, or even build it as your
startup company.

Here is a quick video of how it works. Notice how fast you can go from a project
to a hosted website:

<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:81%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GivingRecklessCormorant?speed=2' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Static site hosting is only the start. Pretty soon you'll be able to host all
sorts of apps and servers on Repl.it.
