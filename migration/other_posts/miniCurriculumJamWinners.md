During EdFest 2022 we started our first Mini Curriculum Jam where anyone with an interest in education was asked to submit a sample project and a video outlining a curriculum that they'd like to build. Our panel of judges (including Sean Glantz, Craig'n'Dave and our Student Panel) have spent the last two-weeks reviewing and scoring the entries and the winners are here!

* Harry and Anna Wake, 14 year olds with their own start up: Mission Encodeable, with their entry that teaches [APIs in Python through building a about joke text sender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egW1afe-SFw) 
* James Abela, a Computer Science teacher, with his project on building a [weather app with real world data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-IOxSZswA)
* [Kody](https://twitter.com/kodylow) and [Lisa](https://twitter.com/niftynei) from [Base58](https://twitter.com/base58btc) who wanted to build out a curriculum all about a [Bitcoin app and CLI tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhVJGHPILDs), teaching the blockchain along the way!

Thanks to everyone that went to the effort of building something for us! We appreciate you (and we were *really* impressed with the quality of all the entries)! 

We're all looking forward to seeing these full curricula appear in the Curriculum Hub soon!
