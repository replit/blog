At Repl.it we focus on simplicity, speed, and, most importantly,
reliability. If you're using Repl.it as your primary or secondary IDE we want
you to be confident that the time you invest working on your code will never go
to waste.

Building on our [autosave feature](new_repls), the underlying infrastructure --
every repl has its own filesystem now -- we've built an automatic revision
system that keeps every revision of code you've ever written stored. The trouble
was, as many of you pointed out, there was no easy way to manage it. That's why
today we're excited to introduce Repl History, a page where you can view files,
drill down to view old revisions by day or by change, diff them against latest,
and finally easily restore them.

Here is a quick gif walkthrough:

You can access this from your repls dashboard or from individual repls by
clicking on the saved/history button.
