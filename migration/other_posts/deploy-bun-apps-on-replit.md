## What is Bun?

Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime that is a direct replacement for Node.js. Last week, Bun launched `v1.0.0`, and the results are remarkable. Not only is Bun much faster than competitors, but  they have highly optimized APIs and a complete toolkit. Everything is out of the box.
