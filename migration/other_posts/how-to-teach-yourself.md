Like many of you, we’ve been stuck at home, trying out new hobbies, attempting to learn new things, and anxiously waiting until life “gets back to normal.” Well, regardless of how you’ve been spending your time during COVID, if you (or a friend or family member) have been wanting to learn how to code, we want to help!

At Repl.it, it’s our mission to make programming easier and more accessible, which is why we’ve built the best programming environment for learners. We built tools to get you coding right away without needing to fuss around with complex setup. But we also make it easy to progressively uncover advanced concepts as you learn, host your code, share and collaborate with friends, and the list goes on.

So true to our mission, today we’re announcing a new course: “How to teach yourself coding.”

<a href="https://forms.gle/ypdm5RL844whTDAB8"><img alt="Teach Yourself Programming Course Registration" src="https://repl.art/boothbot.png"></a>

This one-month course will show you how to get started coding, and how to keep up your momentum when you get stuck. It will start with absolute basics about how computers and programming languages work, and get you started on making your own basic website. The course will include instruction on how to write, fix, and test your own code, how to learn from other peoples’ code, and the basics of computer security and ethics. The primary languages will be HTML/CSS/Javascript, the building blocks of the modern web. By the end of the class, you’ll have a program you built yourself, and you’ll have momentum to keep teaching yourself more.

The course will be taught by celebrity guest teacher, [Andrew Sutherland](https://asuth.com/), who is the founder of [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/), an educational software tool serving millions of students and teachers around the world. Andrew started Quizlet at age 15, when he needed a tool to help himself learn in a high school French class. He then taught himself how to program by building lots of different websites, each one more complex than the next, until he started on Quizlet.
