Hello teachers, and welcome back to another week of updates to [Teams for Education](https://repl.it/teams-for-education). We're continuing to invest heavily in the product, with over half of our engineers working on Teams right now, and are committed to education and to helping give computer science teachers super powers!

Today is the day that we end access to our legacy Classroom product. It has been a very memorable journey and we have come a long way since we first released Classroom in 2016. We want to thank all the teachers who've supported us from the beginning and have allowed Repl.it to grow so much. 

*Just a reminder that any time after today, you can still [migrate your classroom](https://repl.it/classroom-migration) to a free trial of [Teams for Education](https://repl.it/teams-for-education), our new and improved product for teachers and students.*

We hope to see you at the next Teams for Education demo/training webinar on [Wednesday, February 3rd, 2021, at 7 pm eastern standard time](https://meet.google.com/amy-ohzu-qjj). We'll keep offering webinars periodically as we release big new features for Teams.

We've got one final update for you. We just posted an exciting new job opening: [Customer Success and Teacher Community](https://jobs.lever.co/replit/ee097258-fdee-4cd5-8a23-c36d2ad2eb7). And we know the best person for this role will be a teacher from our community. Think that might be you? [Please apply](https://jobs.lever.co/replit/ee097258-fdee-4cd5-8a23-c36d2ad2eb77)! You'll have an opportunity to get in at the ground level of a high-growth startup and help teachers inspire students globally and expand access to computer science education.

Have a fantastic week and happy coding!
