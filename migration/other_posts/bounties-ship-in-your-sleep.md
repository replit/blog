### Introduction

[@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech) is a software developer and Twitter creator. She wanted to test out an idea for a social polling app, similar to popular polling web apps like Gas App, where users would be served a question and could select an option, which would then take them to the next question. However, being busy with work, she decided to outsource the implementation of this idea. After seeing Replit Bounties on Twitter and receiving a recommendation from a friend, [@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech) decided to try it out.

## Building the Prototype

[@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech) posted the problem statement and received 5 high quality applications within a day. By seeing their code examples on Replit & Github, and past Bounty reviews, [@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech) narrowed down on Aditya, a college student from India (Replit Name: @AadiKumawa). 

They communicated via Signal to nail down the prototype and product requirements within 2 days. After that, Aditya used the [t3](https://create.t3.gg/) Next.js framework stack to build the web-app, including the UI and the backend. He also included a special “Invite” button that would create a personalized URL for users to invite their friends to the app.

## Result

[@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech) had used other dev contractor marketplaces in the past and found this Bounty experience very reliable and fast. Once the wireframe was created, creating the web-app was fast and easy, and Aditya was communicative. The entire process from posting the Bounty to receiving the web-app took 1 week and was completed for $600. Using the Replit Bounty model was a much quicker and efficient way to test out this idea without putting a strain on [@girlbossintech](https://twitter.com/girlbossintech)’s bandwidth.


She views Bounties as an RFP model where she can select what to create herself vs. delegating out. By outsourcing this experiment, she saved time and can then decide whether to integrate it with her full-time work or not.
