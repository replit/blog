At Repl.it our mission is to make programming more accessible, and the best way
we found to achieve this is to support, you, the teachers on the ground doing
working with students. That's why we want to make sure you control the student
experience and today we're making it possible to control the assignments order
from your classroom dashboard.[](preview end)

We're giving you seven different sorting options: Alphabetic (both a-z and z-a), Publish
date (both old-new and new-old), Due date (both sooner-later and later-sooner)
and finally, Manual where you'll be able to drag and drop assignments in any
order.

Additionally, we're unifying the teacher’s and the student’s classroom dashboard by
allowing you to choose any reordering option. That means both sides will see the
same assignments order on their classroom dashboard which avoids any kind of
confusion between the teacher and the students.

To remove any friction at the students' end we're removing the sorting
options in the student dashboard. Students will receive the order that their
teacher chose for them; and soon this will allow teachers to add assignment
dependencies which will require students to complete their assignment
before moving to the next one.

And as always, here is a gif of how it looks like:
