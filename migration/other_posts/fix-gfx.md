Since we introduced [native graphics in the browser](https://blog.repl.it/gfx) in 2019, our community has built awesome games and programs in [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), and Java Swing. Being able to write some code and see the results right away is what Replit is all about. That and finding peace in a bouncing DVD logo:

As more and more people have built graphics repls, they've uncovered bugs. Our most frequent bug reports involve X11 not starting, leaving people looking a blank frame instead of running their code. We have heard you! Fixing graphics is now the Platform Team's top priority. We'll fix the outstanding bugs as quickly as we can. Judging by [the last time](https://blog.repl.it/how-far) we went on a fixing spree, graphics should feel significantly better soon.

Thank you for building on Replit! More soon.
