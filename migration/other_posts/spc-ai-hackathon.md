*This is a guest post by [South Park Commons](https://blog.southparkcommons.com/spc-replit-ai-hackathon/). [SPC](https://www.southparkcommons.com/) is a community of 500+ builders, technologists, and domain experts with locations in San Francisco and New York City.*

***

The recent SPC-Replit AI hackathon brought together talented builders from the SPC community and Replit network to show off their technical chops and creativity by building cutting-edge AI applications. Participants had a week to develop a working demo that incorporated AI in some capacity and was built on Replit. From meal planning to baby-AGI's and even a bot that points out logical fallacies, these projects are proof of the limitless potential of AI.

Check out the individual project highlights below!
