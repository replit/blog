**Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access [here](https://replit.com/teams-for-education).*

On Tuesday, we announced that [Teams for Education left beta](https://blog.replit.com/teams_release)! We mentioned that we're continuing to roll out more features to help computer science educators empower the next generation of creators and builders. As promised, project due dates are here!

Now, when creating a project, you'll have the option of setting a due date.

Students are notified when they are submitting late assignments and teachers can easily identify late submissions from the education pane and the submissions dashboard.

We're inspired by the work that students create and [can't wait to hear what features you'd like to see next](https://replit.canny.io/teams-for-education)!
