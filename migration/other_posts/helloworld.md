We're excited to launch this new part of our site.[](preview end) First, we have a place to
share with you all the exciting features we're building (things that don't fit
in a [140 characters](https://twitter.com/replit) and a GIF). You can also look
forward to posts sharing what we learn in engineering and design.

Second, we're putting all the informational pages for our product and company
here. This way you don't have to download tons of JavaScript that is intended
for the development environment when all you want to do is read words. That'll
also make it easier for Google to index our stuff.

For now, you can check out our new [about us page](/site/about), sign up
for our [classroom product beta](/site/classrooms), or checkout our new
languages [landing pages](/languages/java).
