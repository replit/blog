A few weeks ago, we announced Replit Ventures. 12 teams from across the world will receive:
- A $10,000 grant
- Ten weeks of mentorship
- Expertise from guest speakers, including Y Combinator

This is a 10x investment from our last Replit Ventures… but we did not stop there!

Supporting creators & builders is core to Replit, but we are not the only ones that feel that way. Since the announcement, we have been working with best-in-class partners to provide a set of tools for our selected teams to build faster!

Today, we are excited to announce a commitment from eight partners: Stripe, Supabase, Loom, Notion, Linear, Pitch, Figma, and Airtable.
