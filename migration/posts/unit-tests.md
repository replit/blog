Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development & learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. At Replit, our goal is to give people coding superpowers by demolishing barriers and democratizing access to expert tools. Today, we're launching our zero-setup unit testing environment.

At launch we'll support three of our most popular programming languages: Java, Python, and JavaScript pre-setup with the most popular frameworks in each category. We'll be adding more with time, and you can visit our [docs](https://docs.repl.it/repls/UnitTesting) for more information about how to get started.

We think this feature will be handy for CS educators, online course creators, and developers. But as always, we're excited to explore unique ways people will leverage this feature. So let us know how you use it!
