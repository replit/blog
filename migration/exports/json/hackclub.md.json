Being able to tell people that they could build and publish a website in less than 15 minutes is super amazing. Our hackers love that our meetings are a low-stress environment to just create cool stuff. We try to structure our workshops with a 15 minute or less publish time so that everyone can spend the majority of the meeting tinkering around with their project and adding their own features.","_key":"bf4173a1182b0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"a818911faadf","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Later in the year, as hackers venture into creating more complex projects with JavaScript and Python, hackers pair-program, and work on projects collaboratively.

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, our club was forced into a virtual format overnight. This made pair-programming harder, but not impossible. With replit, everything worked almost the same as it did when we were teaching in person; hackers were still able to collaborate together.","_key":"a818911faadf0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"8509a0f75fea","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"8509a0f75fea0","text":"","marks":[]}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"43a1e2033ce5","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"In the 2021-22 school year, weâ€™ve luckily gone back to in-person learning.
