In particular, if the email address on record for a user’s Replit account was not already tied to a GitHub account, an attacker could have created a GitHub account by re-using the email address on record for the user’s Replit account. Under certain conditions, it would have been possible to use that fraudulent GitHub account to impersonate the affected user on Replit. While we have no evidence that a third party logged into any Replit account this way, out of caution, we have logged out of all Replit sessions all users who we could identify as potentially fitting these criteria.","_key":"214abae120640"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"a8758e6d71b1","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Additionally, out of an abundance of caution, we have logged out all users who have ever used our single-sign-on functionality with a GitHub, Facebook, or Apple account.","_key":"a8758e6d71b10"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"304a352d10f3","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"We take the security of our users' accounts seriously.
