Wouldn't it be cool to further enhance the student's knowledge by showing the student different approaches to tackle the same problem?

Model solutions allow you show your students the best way to complete an assignment after they have come to their own working solution. Students will have access to your model solution once they submit their own and it is marked as completed. Model solutions can help you as a teacher demonstrate a preferred coding style, new language features and idioms, or simpler and more efficient algorithms.","_key":"0b39b01c5eab0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"b7e8bac3b579","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"b7e8bac3b5790","text":"","marks":[]}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"7261e1e7d385","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Model solutions can also help teachers debug unit tests.
