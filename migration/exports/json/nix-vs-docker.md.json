This question could be dismissed by saying that Nix and Docker are different tools that solve different problems. One is a toolkit for building and deploying containers and the other is a package and configuration manager. However, these tools do have some overlap: they can both be used to create reproducible environments. A reproducible environment is one that can be recreated from scratch in an identical way (ideally bit-for-bit). Practically, this means having the same tools, versions, and configuration between the environments.","_key":"1a5c4769360a10"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"92a645cf3006","_type":"link","href":"https://nixos.org/"},{"_key":"11835232bf8e","_type":"link","href":"https://www.docker.com/"},{"_key":"684ee38671b0","_type":"link","href":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22295740"},{"_key":"687456cdc9be","_type":"link","href":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23253856"},{"_key":"19f5f000e076","_type":"link","href":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28734457"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"d12b63550c11","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Reproducible environments are useful to ensure all developers on a project have the exact same set of tools.
