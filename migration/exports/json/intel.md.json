When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.","_key":"b908a9dcb3f90"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"e2c7e4eeb421","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"However, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft's VS Code team announced ","_key":"e2c7e4eeb4210"},{"_type":"span","marks":["1d369621e38b"],"text":"\"A Common Protocol for Languages\"","_key":"e2c7e4eeb4211"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":", a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol â€” this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" ","_key":"e2c7e4eeb4212"},{"_type":"span","marks":["077c3ebac024"],"text":"(LSP)","_key":"e2c7e4eeb4213"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":".","_key":"e2c7e4eeb4214"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"1d369621e38b","_type":"link","href":"https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol"},{"_key":"077c3ebac024","_type":"link","href":"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"4a41f64f2996","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"In addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: ","_key":"4a41f64f29960"},{"_type":"span","marks":["3d0039c89c62"],"text":"Monaco","_key":"4a41f64f29961"},{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":".
