Distributed systems that are resilient, as well as those that have any amount of caching in place, benefit from being able to tolerate slightly stale information gracefully, with the knowledge that eventually the whole system will converge into a stable state.

DNS results can be cached for prolonged periods of time, which means that we need to be able to handle the case where a user tries to access their old cluster for that period of time.
