I think the jam was a large success. People were able to receive great feedback, and learn about logging, unit-testing, and documentation. One of the large issues we had in the jam was finding people partners to code with. Some people already knew others on the server, and were able to create partners with ease. Other people had issues, and weren't able to compete due to it. The reason we decided to do then jam this way, is to create cooperative skills. Most students program by themselves, and getting the chance to work together is very rare. And these skills are important, because working with others is used all the time in jobs, or even contributing to open source projects.
