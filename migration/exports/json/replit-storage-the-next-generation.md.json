Each block has a UUID assigned to it when it is created, and also every time a block transitions from being clean (its contents exactly match what was persisted to permanent storage) to being dirty. When there is a btrfs commit, we create a copy of this map, update it with pointers to the new blocks, and persist the blocks with their associated UUID, plus the manifest. So as long as the manifest reads are atomic, we can guarantee that every time there is a fork, we are getting a consistent snapshot of the full filesystem. And now that we have copy-on-write for every Repl, we can do something cool: instant and cheaper forks. A fork of a Repl now only needs to copy the manifest, and all the blocks owned by the original Repl will be copy-on-write modified by the fork, which saves on storage.
