We were embarrassed. We had embarked on a stability sprint and the site felt worse. Increased load on Replit and in particular our legacy Classroom product seemed to have tipped us over a cliff. We added followers to our Postgres database and allowed people to export their classrooms into the much-more-stable Teams for Education, but it wasn't enough. We wanted to stop reacting to growth and put the web app on a solid footing. So we took the time to evenly distribute Postgres connections across all follower databases, cached the most frequently queried objects, and put rate limits in place. Since then latency has looked flat and boring.","_key":"001b3b308b710"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"0882f0f0370d","children":[{"_type":"span","_key":"0882f0f0370d0","text":"","marks":[]}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"506ca9f765a0","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"When you visit a repl, your browser opens a websocket connection to a running container.

And sometimes the machine couldn't cleanly destroy all its containers, meaning the system-wide locks for those repls would outlive their containers, causing all sorts of problems. Once we sped up shutdown, people stopped having to wait 30-plus seconds to be able to connect to certain repls, and a bunch of our metrics started looking dramatically better.","_key":"a9c4ffb6767e0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"e8180be152f2","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"If the websocket connection between the browser and the container closes for any reason, the repl will reconnect automatically.

It means Replit cannot automatically reconcile the local edits you've made to your repl with what's in the container. In August it was much higher.
