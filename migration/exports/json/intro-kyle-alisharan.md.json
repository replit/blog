Over time I came to love it, partly because I got to go deep on something not a lot of folks go deep on at start-ups, and partly because I saw it unlock a lot of growth for us. That took a while but led to a few good things (bootstrapping, recap, acquisitions, and eventually an IPO), so that became my lane over a decade of work. I didn't realize it at the time but that formative experience was, as Amjad put it, \"Finance on hard mode\". Since then I've been the 0 to 1 CFO at several companies going from first Finance employee through building the team, multiple fundraising rounds, and refining the business model to a liquidity event. When I'm not doing that, I'm chasing my kids around (2 little girls) or finding an excuse to be outside.","_key":"6ed2bdb88adb0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"6f0b44f546a9","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"What will you be doing at Replit?","_key":"6f0b44f546a90"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"a2698664e4b6","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"All things Finance (accounting, control, financial planning and analysis, capital strategy, why doesn't my corporate credit card work, etc).
