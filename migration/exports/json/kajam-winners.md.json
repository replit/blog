Seven people stood in the room, held down only by the weight of responsibility they carried with them. One by one they were handed a link to a website- what they would find they did not know. And one by one the links were opened. Colors and music filled the empty air. Excitement gleamed in each of their eyes, their fingers danced across the keyboard, their mouse moved sporadically as though if it stayed still for too long they would surely meet their doom. And yet after another moment, the link was closed, and the display subsided. Each individual scribbled something down, and the cycle repeated four hundred times. After days of deliberation, the people consulted each other and wrote one final list. The list was placed in a red envelope, stamped with a wax seal of the Replit logo. The doors to the darkroom opened, and the individuals left. Leaving the letter behind. Today we will enter that room and open the red envelope, to announce the winners of the 2021 Kajam Game Jam!","_key":"8c31b0df14a40"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"9d7ec3b406d7","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"What was Kajam?","_key":"9d7ec3b406d70"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"h2"},{"_key":"1b59182d1b2a","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Starting October 18th, the Kajam game jam began.
