The thing I liked the most about it was the component model. Until then the JavaScript community has been trying for years to come up with the correct abstraction for creating reusable modules, but it was always leaky. Because React components are essentially functions, and because functions are the undisputed champion of reusable code, it worked out extraordinarily well. You don't need dependency-injection, or any other modularity hacks, you simply pass props! Also, the virtual dom made it so that components are, by default, protected from other components prying into their internals.","_key":"381bd52bb6694"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"ebe3c4a3f7e5","_type":"link","href":"https://twitter.com/cowboy/status/339858717451362304"},{"_key":"aa641b584292","_type":"link","href":"https://reactjs.org/"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"fd07b17eb5a0","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"That's just one aspect of what made me love React and it was a significant factor in me applying to work for Facebook in 2013.
