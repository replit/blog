For them, these aren’t hypothetical questions. They have to rely on informal, unreliable, unprofessional, and oftentimes frustrating ways to send goods to customers who desperately need them delivered. They typically resort to using individual, independent motorbike taxi drivers. They’d stop a random driver on the street, hand him the package, provide rough verbal directions and a phone number of the customer to call when nearby. These hacks pose many challenges including the lack of trust and professionalism (motorbike drivers are just independent individuals unaffiliated with any company), slow delivery speed (need for additional directions over phone calls), lack of appropriate delivery tools, and inability to track deliveries. For businesses, these challenges frequently lead to stolen, lost, or damaged packages and frustrations due to inefficiencies, awful customer experience as well as limitations on the type and value of the package they’d be comfortable sending through this approach.","_key":"44cf6ddc03660"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"28063f35975f","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"Informal delivery in Kigali, Rwanda.

Using mobile and web applications, businesses are now able to deliver goods to their customers even in the absence of physical addresses. To achieve this, Nisawa uses an embedded map with thousands of “landmarks” which include businesses, schools, churches, or government offices that can be used as reference points for delivery purposes. Given the ubiquity of such landmarks in African cities, any location is typically within 200 meters of a landmark. After narrowing down to a nearby landmark, the exact location (geographical coordinates) is then pinpointed on the map. Alternatively, a user can elect to use the current location of her device or securely share her location with a specific business through the app. Once all the delivery details are in place, a delivery driver best positioned to perform the delivery is dispatched and notified via our driver mobile app.","_key":"4c38bbd83da60"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"8d4a58eaf156","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"Delivery box mounted on a regular motorbike.","_key":"8d4a58eaf1560"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"3b4155858923","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Another important aspect of Nisawa’s delivery solution is the delivery containers.

Through RV0, our single focus became to make sure we grow the number of deliveries by at least 15% each week. To achieve this goal, we had to make a couple of changes. First of all, although we knew the biggest demand was coming from businesses, we were still trying to appeal to both consumers and businesses i.e. C2C and B2C deliveries. This has since changed as businesses are now at the center of everything we do and it is much easier to make decisions whether about product or marketing. Secondly, we made sure every single person on the team -- including delivery drivers -- understands our weekly goal. These seemingly small changes have brought many ideas that have enabled us to almost triple the number of weekly deliveries in just four weeks.","_key":"10df9567c5ef0"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"5bc2144dc895","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The problem of unreliable delivery in African cities isn’t new. Until recently, cash payment upon delivery was a major obstacle to creating a successful solution. Without any upfront payment, time-sensitive customers could easily change plans and cancel deliveries after a driver is dispatched. Moreover, delivery drivers would spend a lot of time collecting cash and looking for change. Such hurdles made deliveries inefficient and operations hard to manage. With Covid-19, mobile money adoption has more than doubled and now most customers can pay digitally using their mobile wallets. As most people in African cities already have smartphones with an internet connection, for the first time we see a path that can lead to a widely adopted and robust delivery infrastructure that allows businesses to serve their customers reliably.
