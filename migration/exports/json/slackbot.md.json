So one goal of mine was to be able to create something just like they do every day. Mind you, in no way am I experienced in programming; I actually find it quite intimidating (my background is business). However, I wanted to challenge myself and start off small by creating a Slack bot that can automatically send our ‚ÄúWeekly Wins‚Äù thread.","_key":"44e9cfafeec00"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"21f2935e0db6","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"To get started, I wanted to familiarize myself with how creating a messaging bot works, whether it was for discord or slack.

The next step was actually to start setting it up. I created a slack app and got all the configurations ready. After that, I created a repl and started following the videos code. Making it on Replit made it so much easier because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about setting up the environment and installing any other stuff needed. After I got the base of everything, the fun part came! This is where I got to play around with what message I wanted to send, when, and where. I will admit it was a bit of a struggle trying to get the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù module to work how I wanted it to, but after a couple of days of brainstorming and help from the team, we realized the issue was timezone differences. After we adjusted that, it was a success!","_key":"21f2935e0db62"}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"74ac1022d861","_type":"link","href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ5bFv-IRFM"}],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"b9bd7699b984","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"With this slack bot, we now don‚Äôt have to worry about manually sending it every week, which is super helpful. I would also say creating a test environment was also very useful, so the main channel doesn‚Äôt get spammed.
