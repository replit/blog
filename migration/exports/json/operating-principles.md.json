Sadly most people are mere consumers of these machines. Only a relative few–the professional software developer–can use this superpower to its fullest extent. It’s creating an unbalanced world where there are programmers, and then there are those who are programmed. The situation is analogous to literacy before the printing press, where only the powerful had access to books and written communication. The invention of the printing press led to democratic, scientific, and industrial revolutions, but it took about a century from creation to revolution, which meant that an entire generation of people had to grow up with new skills, outlooks, and ways of learning and communicating.","_key":"25d568cf07510"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"b3a12da32385","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Replit exists to bring the next billion software creators online.
