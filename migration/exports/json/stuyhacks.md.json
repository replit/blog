As a San Francisco native taking the New York subway system and then walking in Manhattan downtown (it was Chinatown but New York City is big and confusing enough for me to simply call it downtown), it was certainly a different environment. For starters, it was pretty hot, like well beyond the hot it gets in San Francisco where it’s always foggy. Additionally, there’s a good amount of traffic and honking in the street which puzzled me as to why anyone bothered driving if all they’re doing is sitting around all day.","_key":"acdb00a4f9870"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"5730b6ef7094","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Once I entered the venue, I was greeted by the team then I laid out a bunch of Repl.it stickers on the table for attendees to pick up and place on their laptops while checking in to the event.

The chances are that not too many of you reading this will understand what that emacs thing meant but, for people attending the event, they all understood the joke and laughed. This was pretty surprising since it’s not everyday that you see high school students knowing what emacs is let alone a whole room of them. The reason this occurred was because, at Stuyvesant high school, a computer science teacher has his students use emacs for his class so they all had the pleasure of pressing C-x C-c on their keyboards and opening vim instead.","_key":"c2843712e2a70"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"26cbed3a34f7","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"I led the first workshop right after the opening ceremony that taught people how to make their first website using HTML and CSS.
