I sent out 75 invites, and we received 46 responses within the four-day deadline. We asked our candidates to attempt our code challenge within an hour and use whichever language they felt most comfortable in. Sure we look to see if they have an elegant solution, but we also have an internal tool to see when and how each line of code is written and how long someone spent on the challenge.","_key":"3f5eee45cd640"}],"markDefs":[],"_type":"block","style":"normal"},{"_key":"21f33651a20c","children":[{"_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Step 2: I went deeper into each candidate's solution and resume.

Additionally, it's a very positive signal to have at least one project that you love and can't help but nerd out on when asked about it.

What we're looking for in this interview from new talent is skills, yes, but more importantly, we're interested in how you tackle a difficult task.

I affectionately dubbed it \"The Babe Ruth.\" Before I even looked at an application, I interviewed our two current engineering interns. Two things that stood out were the fact that they were community members before joining us and had strong opinions on how they can improve other Repliters' experience. They pitched Amjad with their ideas and were hired because of their initial plans and their promising skills. So, we did our best to recreate this process.

It is a fact that there are a few bad actor companies out there that use the interview process for free work from talented programmers. I strongly encourage you to feel comfortable declining any code challenge, interview, or job where your gut tells you something is wrong. I know that we are not one of those companies, but how do you convey that fact to a potential teammate when they don't know you and the team well yet? After some reflection, I decided to keep our Babe Ruth step and ban our final interview candidates from sharing their idea with us until we connected for the presentation, which of course, we don't record. After all, thoughts are a dime a dozen.

We currently don't have any official project managers, so everyone on our team quickly becomes comfortable with PMing. While the mentor will help train their mentee in this, our goal was to give each candidate that made it to the final interview a chance to demonstrate this natural talent or existing skill.
