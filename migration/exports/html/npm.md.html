<p>Last year we introduced support for importing <a href="python-import">any Python package from
PyPi</a> and -- although we don&#39;t have perfect support for all
packages -- it turned out to be a very popular feature. That&#39;s why today we&#39;re
excited to continue the roll-out for the rest of our platform starting with
web-based languages. [](preview end)</p>
<p>Whether you&#39;re using plain old <a href="/languages/javascript">JavaScript REPL</a>,
<a href="/languages/html">HTML/CSS/JS</a>, or <a href="/languages/babel">ES2016</a>, you&#39;ll be
able to import any package from npm (that can run in the browser).</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/library.gif" alt="require packages"></p>
<p>How it works is that we parse out the requires from your code,
fetch the bundle from npm via <a href="https://wzrd.in">wzrd.in</a>, and evaluate the
bundle in the same context as your code.</p>
<p>Note that ES6 imports is not currently supported but we&#39;re hoping to get it in soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/NamPNQ">Phạm Ngọc Quang Nam</a> for his work on this
feature, npm for the registry, and wzrd.in for the awesome packaging service.</p>
