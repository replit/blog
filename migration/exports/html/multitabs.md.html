<p>Repl.it is a great place for prototyping ideas and starting new projects. However as your projects get bigger, the editing experience starts feeling a little limited. That&#39;s why we&#39;re exciting to announce that we&#39;re adding support for tabs!</p>
<p>With the new multitab layout, you can open files in new tabs so that you can quickly switch back to them later.</p>
<p>There are a few ways of opening a file in a new tab:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl + Click</code> (or <code>Cmd + Click</code> on MacOS) the file in the filetree</li>
<li>Drag the file from the filetree directly onto the header or onto an open tab in the header</li>
<li>Right click on the file and hit &quot;Open tab&quot; in the menu</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, you can hit the &quot;X&quot; to the right of the file name to close the tab.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a demo of what that looks like:</p>

<p>You can also drag tabs around to reorder them like so:</p>

<p>We hope this makes it easier to build larger projects on Repl.it. Happy hacking!</p>
