<p>If you&#39;re interested in learning to code, you&#39;ve come to the right place. This guide will walk through why you should learn to code, the &quot;best&quot; language to learn, and quick guides so you can build your first project in under an hour. </p>
<h3>Why should you learn to code anyway?</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 26.9 million developers in the world. That&#39;s around 0.34% of the world population. Only a very small percentage of the world are builders, yet they&#39;re responsible for almost all technology we use on a day-to-day basis. Learning to code will give you the ability to build the products you want to see in the world.</p>
<p>The truth is you don&#39;t need to be a genius to code. Anyone can code. You don&#39;t need a particular skill set or IQ level. You just need to be curious. Like everything else in life, learning to code is intimidating at first. Once you jump in, you&#39;ll realize it&#39;s not as bad as it first seemed. </p>
<h3>What is the best language to learn first?</h3>
<p>The answer is: it&#39;s complicated. It ultimately depends on what you&#39;d like to build. I&#39;ll shout out a few languages you can start with below and why they&#39;d be good fits. To be honest, it&#39;s more important to make the choice to start learning a language than picking the &quot;perfect&quot; language. Don&#39;t let the fear of picking the wrong language stop you from learning to code in the first place. </p>
<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<p>Python&#39;s easy-to-read syntax and versatility make it a great first language to learn. Python code can also often read like English making it easier to learn fundamental concepts. It&#39;s one of the world&#39;s most popular programming languages and much of what you&#39;d be interested in building can be built with Python.</p>
<p><strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong></p>
<p>HTML and CSS are the frameworks used to build websites. They are great starting languages if you&#39;re interested in front-end or web development. They&#39;re sibling languages and HTML dictates what content appears on a web page, while CSS dictates how that content appears. If you&#39;re solely interested in building websites, learning HTML &amp; CSS are a great first choice. </p>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re somewhat experienced with HTML &amp; CSS, JavaScript is a great next language to learn. JavaScript will allow you to turn static web pages into dynamic ones. A lot of people recommend JavaScript as a first language to learn because you can easily test code right from your browser. Replit allows you to do this with every major language, so I wouldn&#39;t choose JavaScript for this sole reason.</p>
<p><strong>How to start coding?</strong></p>
<p>There are almost limitless options when it comes to learning to code. You could join a coding bootcamp, read books, or even jump into a community. The issue is all of these cost money or require a high upfront commitment. One of the best ways to learn to code is to simply start building. I&#39;ve listed out below the 10 best resources to get you started. Feel free to pick the resource that interests you the most.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/">Build a Discord bot with Python</a></strong></p>
<p>This guide was created by freeCodeCamp. It walks you through building the Discord Bot step by step and explains the code snippets along the way. It has both a written and video tutorial, so you can choose whichever fits your learning style.</p>
<p><em>Note: Replit now has private repls so you won&#39;t need to IMPORT OS or create a .env file for your private bot token. This will make more sense if you choose this guide.</em></p>
