Developers, offshore or onshore can get hired quickly and be a part of virtual or real teams once they complete required certifications and fulfill qualifications. So, how to become a Python developer?</p>
<h2>Skills Required to Get Hired as A Python Developer — How to Become a Developer</h2>
<p>Since Python is one of the simplest languages, entry-level candidates can learn fast and upgrade themselves easily. It would be good to know that the top recruiters look for Python developers who are in-tune with the most demanding technologies and specialties.</p>
<p>How long does it take to learn Python? A focused student can learn it in eight weeks. Of course, it’s impossible to know every single Python framework, but knowing the main ones is fast and — obviously — vital. Math skills and the ability to design software that can easily perform large-scale computations always help.</p>
<p>What should a Python developer know? Overall, the key skills you need can be graded in terms of importance:</p>
<h3>I. Most Important – Core Python, Python frameworks, and Python libraries</h3>
<h4><em>Core Python</em></h4>
<p>A clear understanding of Core Python will ultimately be the deciding factor in a developer’s ability to finish projects. Thankfully, it is not hard to master this general-purpose programming language that’s considered very “developer-friendly”. To know core Python, the developer must be familiar with each module. Knowing the distinctions between Python 2 and 3, for instance, is very important. However, these distinctions are not a very problematic thing to learn. What’s most important is to have a clear understanding of Python’s data structures and the fundamental concepts. The ‘must know’ list of core Python concepts includes iterators, generators, exception handling, realizing the inner-workings of sets or dicts, basic file handling concepts, OOPs concepts, variables, and data types.</p>
<h4><em>Python Frameworks</em></h4>
<p>Knowledge of Python frameworks is an absolute must for anyone who wants to get involved in app development. These frameworks automate the application of most-used solutions, allowing Python developers to avoid the hassle of dealing with routine elements. However, it’s impossible for a Python developer to be well-versed in all frameworks. At first, it’s best to focus on learning the most popular frameworks such as Sanic, Flask, CherryPy, TurboGears, Pyramid, and Django.</p>
<h4><em>Python Libraries</em></h4>
<p>A Python developer who has a mastery over the <a href="https://pythontips.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/">most used Python libraries</a> will be more efficient in his role, executing tasks and projects way quicker. Study the libraries after assessing the scope of the task. Above all, Python is a programming language that has a large supporter base. You can find many resources if you search at the right online repositories.</p>
<h3>II. Very Important – Front-End Knowledge, MySQL, ORM Libraries</h3>
<h4><em>Basic Front-End Knowledge (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) [For Web Projects]</em></h4>
<p>Python developers working in development teams will have to cooperate with front-end developers.</p>
<p>Without basic front-end knowledge, Python developers usually cannot understand the client-side of projects. Knowing basic project details such as how the application looks, whether the front-end is easy to use for clients, possible front-end limitations, etc. is very important for a Python Developer.</p>
<p>Of course, when you take up positions in top-quality software houses, you’ll have team leads, dedicated project managers, and other professionals supervising the workflow and sharing their experience. But if your goal is to be a valuable member of the team, some understanding of front-end operations always helps.</p>
<h4><em>MySQL [for Data Science]</em></h4>
<p>Although a clear understanding of Core Python is the most important thing, knowledge of SQL plays a decisive factor, especially for people looking for jobs in data science.</p>
<p>Most of the leading tech companies (Amazon, Google, etc.) use SQL to query data and analyze the performances of specific frameworks.</p>
<p>SQL is a trusted field and its use is ubiquitous in tech. Every project involves the use of either SQL or SQL derivative.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many developers start their path in Data Science from learning SQL and then moving to Python, so we believe this should not be an issue for a Python developer who only starts their career.</p>
<p>By the way, SQL is the <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/why-sql-is-the-most-important-language-to-learn/">most mentioned skill</a>) in recruitment ads.</p>
<h4><em>Knowledge of ORM libraries</em></h4>
<p>Knowledge of ORM Libraries (Object Relational Mapper) is vital for developers looking to master the database creation process. Familiarity with ORM Libraries will make it much easier and faster to make database schema changes. Overall, it’s a skill that looks good on any Python Developer’s CV.</p>
<h3>III. Important Skills – Version Control and Soft Skills</h3>
<h4><em>Version Control</em></h4>
<p>Life can be difficult for a Python Developer who can’t keep track of all the changes he makes to a file. Given this, version control systems enable software developers to make changes to source code as required. Git is the most popular system developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Aspiring developers can go through the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/git-master-git-version-control-system">Git tutorial</a> to learn about version control tools and the basics of Git including terminologies, installation fundamentals, and more.</p>
<h4><em>Soft skills</em></h4>
<p>Last but not least, all future Python Developers must obtain soft skills that help them become efficient team players and vital members of the organization. Skills such as emotional intelligence, cooperation skills, proactive mindset, ability to use feedback, adaptability, work ethic, and listening skills are all very important. These are the basic skills that are required for any kind of software developer.</p>

<h2>How to Land a Job as a Python Developer</h2>
<h3>Creating a Flawless CV</h3>
<p>Now that you know where to find the best Python developer jobs, it’s time to start drafting your official resume. Make sure your CV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlights your best qualities.</li>
<li>Has a standard chronological format. This format is easily readable and consists of different sections that you can appropriately title and expand. Choose a <a href="https://zety.com/blog/chronological-resume">professional resume template</a> that has the correct font requirements (11–12pt is perfectly readable).</li>
<li>Is in the correct format that the employers asked for in the posting.</li>
<li>Has a well-defined header, resume summary, and your contact details.</li>
<li>Has a separate experience section explaining your professional experience (focus on listing achievements, not processes).</li>
<li>Has a separate section for education details and one for details about your professional skills as a Python developer.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add additional details such as extra-curricular activities (e.g., a hackathon win), interests, etc. Keep the information structured and to the point, no matter where you’re uploading it to — a corporate website or one of the freelance hiring platforms.</p>
<h3>Soft Skills Assessment</h3>
<p>Be it a video call or a face to face meetings, most first meetings in the tech industry involve the interviewer getting a sense of the candidate as a person, cooperative skills, communication skills, and basic problem-solving skills. Let your CV do your bidding. Answer as you’re asked and demonstrate qualities such as reliability or flexibility in dealing with different aspects of Python programming. What should a Python developer know before entering a soft skill assessment? To stay ahead of fellow applicants, use this <a href="https://youteam.io/remote-developer-interview-tool">remote developer interview tool</a>, and answer the most asked questions in these interviews.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youteam.io/blog/how-to-vet-tech-candidates-especially-when-hiring-remotely-best-practices-in-2020/">Hard Skills Verification</a></h3>
<p>The conventional hard skills verification process consists of:</p>
<h4>Office-Based Test Assignments</h4>
<p>Applicants get a small task that they need to fulfill in real-time. These office tests act as platforms where candidates can demonstrate problem-solving skills, time management, and adaptability skills.
