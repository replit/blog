<p>We offer distinctly different experiences in our classroom product and in our main Repls product.  New IDE features are usually brought to Repls first, and after some time, ported to the classroom.  However, there are still some features that are not yet available in classroom - folders, hosting, and back-end web applications.  Many teachers have the desire to use Repls in the classroom, and we are happy to announce that possibility through Classroom Projects.</p>
<p>Classroom Projects allow you to create a repl through classroom and administer that repl to your students.  Students who begin the project will automatically fork the template repl and have access to the full power of the Repls IDE.  Additionally, the project repl can be of any language, regardless of the originating classroom language.  Teachers can view their students&#39; repls at any time, even if the student changes its name.  This product is free for all teacher accounts - sign up <a href="/signup?teacher=1">here</a> if you haven&#39;t already.</p>

<p>Classroom Projects can be used in a myriad of ways.  Here are a few examples of how Classroom Projects can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student repls can be hosted and shared with anyone</li>
<li>Python students can foray into back-end programming with Flask or Django</li>
<li>Projects can be an exploratory space for students to experiment with a language</li>
<li>Students can be given work that stays with their account, even after the classroom has ended.</li>
</ul>
