<p>People in our community build awesome games, apps, and websites on Repl.it&#39;s web
programming environment, but until now they didn&#39;t have any easy way of sharing
these creations with other people.</p>
<p>But today we&#39;re fixing this: every web program you write we will automatically
host for you under a subdomain with your name. You&#39;re then free to share the
website, make it your homepage, submit it as homework, or even build it as your
startup company.</p>
<p>Here is a quick video of how it works. Notice how fast you can go from a project
to a hosted website:</p>
<div style='position:relative;padding-bottom:81%'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/GivingRecklessCormorant?speed=2' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Static site hosting is only the start. Pretty soon you&#39;ll be able to host all
sorts of apps and servers on Repl.it.</p>
