<p>A few weeks ago, we announced Replit Ventures. 12 teams from across the world will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A $10,000 grant</li>
<li>Ten weeks of mentorship</li>
<li>Expertise from guest speakers, including Y Combinator</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a 10x investment from our last Replit Ventures… but we did not stop there!</p>
<p>Supporting creators &amp; builders is core to Replit, but we are not the only ones that feel that way. Since the announcement, we have been working with best-in-class partners to provide a set of tools for our selected teams to build faster!</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce a commitment from eight partners: Stripe, Supabase, Loom, Notion, Linear, Pitch, Figma, and Airtable.</p>
