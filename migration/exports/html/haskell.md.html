<p>We heard your requests for Haskell and today we&#39;re excited to finally announce
Haskell as yet another language we support. We&#39;ve decided to put our focus on
adding more functional languages, starting with Haskell, so you can expect more
very soon.[](preview end)</p>
<p>Right now, the Haskell repl has few limitations. In the repl, <code>stdout</code> won&#39;t be
echoed until your program completes execution, and <code>stdin</code> is completely ignored.
So if you want to use something like <code>getLine</code>, it&#39;s probably best to put that
in the editor. Aside from that, it should behave eactly like
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">ghci</a>.</p>
<p>You can give it a try right now at
<a href="https://repl.it/languages/haskell">repl.it/languages/haskell</a>. Let us know what you think.</p>
<p>And as always here&#39;s a gif of what you can expect:
