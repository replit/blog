<p>We strive to make the workspace as useful as possible while keeping it intuitive
and approachable. We get a crazy number of requests for features every day, not
to mention our own ideas. It becomes a challenging balance between feature creep
and simplicity. Lately we&#39;ve added a few of these features that we hope you&#39;ll
find useful and, if not, you won&#39;t even notice they&#39;re there.</p>
<h1>Formatting in Javascript</h1>
<p>Javascript is the first language where we&#39;ve introduced an automatic formatter.
If you click the

icon we&#39;ll run your code through <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">prettier</a>
which reprints your code in a consistent style.

We&#39;ve already been using prettier internally since it first came out in and it
has been a huge win. We&#39;ll be rolling out formatters for other languages in the
future.</p>
<h1>Uploading Files</h1>
<p>We now support upload any file off your computer and into the workspace. This
includes images which will be displayed as you&#39;d expect. For example, you could
write a program which takes an image and turns it into a rotating gif. Then
upload an image of your choice, click run, and out pops the result:

(you can try it out for yourself <a href="https://repl.it/Klxc/12">here</a>)</p>
<h1>Downloading Files</h1>
<p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to work on your repl outside of Replit, or take what
you&#39;ve built and deploy it. Well now you can. Any file in your repl can be
downloaded on to your computer.

Uploading really wouldn&#39;t be complete without it.</p>
