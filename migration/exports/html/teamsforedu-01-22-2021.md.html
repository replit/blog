<p>*<em>Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is now free to all educators. You can gain access <a href="https://replit.com/teams-for-education">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello teachers, we hope you&#39;re enjoying the new features we&#39;ve been adding  to Teams for Education! At Repl.it we are dedicated to empowering teachers and want to be the first tool you turn to when you&#39;re inspiring the next generation of engineers and builders.</p>
<p><em>First a quick reminder: we are ending access to the legacy Classroom product after January 31st. You can <a href="https://repl.it/classroom-migration">migrate your classroom</a> anytime to a free trial of <a href="https://repl.it/teams">Teams for Education</a>, our new and improved product for teachers and students. Teams is <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/privacyFAQs">FERPA/COPPA and privacy compliant</a> and offers new tools such as <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">real-time multiplayer collaboration</a>, <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/InputOutput">auto-grading</a> and <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Annotations">code conversations</a> that will take your teaching to a new level.</em></p>
<p>This week we&#39;re excited to announce...</p>
<h3>Project Sharing!</h3>
<p>Teachers can now bulk copy and share projects to any Team. This feature is useful for a single teacher managing multiple classes or sharing curriculum with your colleagues. Sharing and bulk copying is managed using a secure private link that is created by the team admin. We hope this will save you a lot of time.</p>
