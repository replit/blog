<p>Today Ghostwriter comes with four AI features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/complete-code">Complete Code</a></strong> - Ghostwriter&#39;s flagship feature, providing in-line code suggestions as you type.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/explain-code">Explain Code</a></strong> - Highlight any block of code you want explained, and Ghostwriter will walk through it step-by-step in plain English.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/transform-code">Transform Code</a></strong> - Take a piece of code, describe changes you want to make to it, and Ghostwriter will re-write it with the changes you wanted.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.replit.com/ghostwriter/generate-code">Generate Code</a></strong> - Tell Ghostwriter what functions or program you want written and let Ghostwriter generate code to help solve your problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these four features, you have paranormal powers at your fingertips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automate repetitive boilerplate code</strong> like function and file generation.</li>
<li><strong>Quickly transform and refactor</strong> large code blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Learn faster and get unstuck</strong> while learning new skills.</li>
<li><strong>Creatively express yourself</strong> by prompting Ghostwriter in plain English to write code for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing is believing. Let us show you what Ghostwriter can do for you.</p>
<h2>Ghostwriter is your pair programmer</h2>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s from your lesson plan, or maybe it is something you wrote weeks ago. Either way, you may look at a few lines of code and think... what does that mean?</p>
<p>Ask Ghostwriter to give you a step-by-step explanation of the code.</p>

<h2>Team Shoutouts!</h2>
<p>This was a major team effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex and Giuseppe built Complete Code</li>
<li>Jonathan and Krish built Generate Code and Transform Code</li>
<li>Jonathan and Arnav built Explain Code</li>
<li>Muhammad and Samip worked on the AI model backing Complete Code</li>
</ul>
<p>When we launch a new product line like Ghostwriter, it takes more than just engineers building the feature itself: Jonathan, Ted, Devin, Aman, and Søren built out the onboarding experience and purchase flow you’ll go through, as well as the Ghostwriter webpage.</p>
