<p>Remember how I said three weeks ago (see the first week of my journey <a href="https://blog.repl.it/anyone-can-code-week1">here</a>) that anyone can code? Well, it really is true. In fact, I am kind of impressed with myself in how quickly I have been able to figure out the basics of coding ;). Using <a href="https://repl.it/~">Replit,</a> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">online tutorials</a>, <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/html/html-figure-image-elements-c42D8uv">videos</a>, and the guidance of a <a href="https://repl.it/talk/learn/Getting-Started-with-HTML-in-10-minutes/16821">few experts</a> (at Repl.it) has made the learning curve way less intimidating. But if you follow along with me, it can be easy for you too!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/week3.png" alt="week 3: learning basics of html"></p>
<p>Last week (read about it <a href="https://blog.repl.it/anyone-can-code-week2">here</a>), I broke down the two languages I would be using - HTML and CSS -  and how to get started with Repl.it. After some self-training and trial and error with the mock Repl I made last week, I decided to jump in this week to create my actual project, a holiday e-card on a custom domain (remember domain is just the place the information is housed and is the name of the website). </p>
<p>First, I decided to create an outline with all the text I wanted to add to my web page. Next, I started a new Repl and gave it a name. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.1.png" alt="new repl"></p>
<p>My first assumption was that creating a new Repl would be like creating a totally blank new document. I was wrong. At first I saw some text that looked like gibberish (trust me though, once you understand, it isn’t overwhelming at all). On the first line of your brand new Repl, you will see <em>doctype html.</em> All this means is this text is communicating to your web browser as an HTML doc. The HTML document itself begins with <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> and ends with <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>. Next you will see <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and the information contained inside is the title and meta title for your website. For those of you who are about to google “meta title”, I will save you the trouble. A “meta title” is the text you see when you hover over a web page tab in your browser.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, when you start a new Repl, you will not have to think about any of this. Easy! So where do I actually add the text that I want to display? All your text, images, titles, etc. will go between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.2.png" alt="html tags"></p>
<p>Now let’s get started adding some text. As your Repl stands now, there’s nothing to display. Referencing my outline that I made at the start, I created my heading first. Remember, last week we discussed the tags you would use to alert the browser if the text is a heading, paragraph, etc.? I chose to use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag as this is the largest heading style. Make sure you use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the beginning and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> at the end. I had to learn this the hard way...more to come in a minute. I hit the big green “run” button after every step to make sure that the code worked.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.3.png" alt="header"></p>
<p>Next, I added my main text using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph tag and a smaller heading using <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>. Once again I kept pressing “run” at each step. Just keep repeating these simple steps to add content to your website!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.4.png" alt="paragraphs"></p>
<p>One cool feature I like is how Repl will predict the tag I am going to use which makes it so much easier and faster than always looking everything up. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.5.png" alt="autofill"></p>
<p>Ok. So now for what I thought was going to be the hardest part: adding an image. I wanted my image to appear after <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> but before <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Thankfully, this wasn’t too hard. To add an image, start by typing <code>&lt;img</code>. (Notice there’s NO ending <code>&gt;</code> here! I got this wrong at first, but quickly figured it out.) Now type <code>src=</code> which refers to the source of your image. You can link to an image on another website or an image you uploaded to your Repl.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.6.png" alt="img src"></p>
<p>I chose to upload my image to Repl from my computer. It’s easy, just click on “new file” (hint: it’s the icon on the left next to “Files”), and upload your image. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.7.png" alt="add file"></p>
<p>Pay attention to the name of your image! Now after <code>src=</code>, type the name of the image EXACTLY as it is saved, including the type of file it is (e.g. familypic*.jpg*). Next, type <code>alt=</code>. Have you ever noticed how when you hover over an image sometimes a description of the picture will show up? That’s the “alt text” in action. Lastly, you can set your image’s height and width restrictions. I ended up choosing 500 pixels for both. At first, the picture was huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.8.png" alt="img tag"></p>
<p>I was so proud of myself for understanding and properly (or so I thought) inputting all this code. However, when I hit “run”, this is what I got! Do you see an image? Nope! Remember, how I said pay attention to the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. I had typed <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;img</code>. Just saved you 10 minutes of problem solving… you’re welcome. (Oh and remember to add the closing <code>&gt;</code> after <code>src</code>, <code>alt</code>, etc.)</p>

<p>So, drum roll please….here is my finished (for this week) product using HTML. I did it!!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/anyone-can-code/3.10.png" alt="webpage"></p>
<p>Join me <a href="https://blog.repl.it/anyone-can-code-week4">next week</a> as I add some holiday cheer to this e-card with CSS! Let’s be honest; right now it is a tad boring… And remember, <a href="https://repl.it/~">Repl.it</a> is FREE and super easy to use. Keep sharing with friends and family who are just getting started with coding too. Thanks for following along!</p>
