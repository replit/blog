<p>Ever since we introduced third-party package support for Python we&#39;ve seen an
explosion of exciting programs on Repl.it. Everything from games to
machine-learning applications that just weren&#39;t possible before.</p>
<p>Today we&#39;re happy to announce that we&#39;re expanding this to support
Node.js. Just <code>require</code> your dependencies and we&#39;ll handle the rest for you.
Here is a working repl that gets my Github stats. It uses <code>request</code> to
fetch the data and <code>underscore</code> to filter the relevant stats.</p>

<p>This is an early (open beta) release so please let us know if you hit any bugs
or issues. We&#39;re currently working on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>package.json support: if you have a <code>package.json</code> in your project we&#39;ll use
that instead of parsing the requires. This will likely come in the next couple of
days.</li>
<li>Caching: if you install a package on a repl it will be cached forever.</li>
<li>Global caching: if you or someone else on Repl.it installs a package we&#39;ll
centrally cache it to make subsequent installs faster.</li>
</ul>
