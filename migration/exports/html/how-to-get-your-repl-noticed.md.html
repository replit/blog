<h3>Make a Clear Title &amp; Description</h3>
<p>Clear and simple titles capture the community&#39;s attention. It should be a sneak peak into what your project is about so that readers can understand enough to want to click through and check out your project.</p>
<p><strong>Good title examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whack-a-mole Flask App</strong> - mentioning your tech stack -- in this case, Flask -- and what your app does -- Whack-a-Mole -- will help attract others that are learning the same tech stack</li>
<li><strong>Remy&#39;s Adventure</strong> - the official title of your game or app works as long as you have a good description to support it (more on that below)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bad title examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My app</strong> - too vague, try your best to include some context about your project and what it does</li>
<li><strong>FREE DOGECOIN - DOWNLOAD NOW</strong> - mentioning currencies, free items, or free content that is under copyright could turn other users off and flag your Repl as being against Replit&#39;s <a href="https://replit.com/site/terms">terms of service</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/publishing-tips/3-title.png" alt="Img 3 - Basics"></p>
<p>Next, use your description to give clear instructions on how to use your Repl, provide some background, and have some fun!</p>
<p>A good structure to follow is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First lines</strong> - Intro / your project&#39;s purpose</li>
<li><strong>Next lines</strong> - Tips &amp; Instructions on how to use your Repl</li>
<li><strong>Final lines</strong> - Cool features or backstories</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#39;s the description for our &quot;Hello World&quot; Repl:</p>
<pre><code>This is a Flask web app that says &quot;Hello World&quot; in 1 of 5 different languages:
- English
- Spanish
- French
- Hindi
- Indonesian

The language is chosen randomly every time the app runs! If you open the website, reload to be greeted in a different language!
</code></pre>

<h3>Add Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are important because they help your Repl get discovered by other community members looking for Repls like yours.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to include tags related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>any competitions your Repl is participating in (e.g. #kajam)</li>
<li>the programming languages or frameworks you used (e.g. #python)</li>
<li>any Replit features you used (e.g. #kaboomjs #replitdb)</li>
</ul>
<p>With our &quot;Hello World&quot; Repl, we&#39;re going to use <code>#python</code>, <code>#app</code>, <code>#flask</code>, <code>#helloworld</code>, <code>#languages</code>.</p>

<h3>Icon &amp; Cover</h3>
<p>Your icon and cover images act like your Repls&#39; thumbnail. Use this space to make your project pop in the community feed.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/publishing-tips/6-icon.png" alt="Img 6 - icon"></p>
<p>Make sure your images are relevant to your project and look clean. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/publishing-tips/ex-good-vs-bad.png" alt="Img - good vs bad cover"></p>
<p>We recommend these dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>200 x 200 (1:1) for your icon</li>
<li>750 x 250 (3:1) for your cover</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your Repl is published, share it with friends and followers on places like Twitter, Discord, or TikTok!
A great place to land your first users and get some friendly feedback is in the <a href="https://discord.util.repl.co/join">Replit Discord</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve also seen projects take off on TikTok where you can post a simple &quot;How To&quot; video like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@talaexe/video/7078456951826435333">this one</a> or a hype screen recording like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zippycode/video/7080541743069826309">this one</a>!</p>
<p>Here are some final tips to get others to fall in love with your project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respond to comments</strong> - people love to meet the creator behind a project. Answer questions and make your Repl&#39;s comment section a fun place to hang!</li>
<li><strong>Act on user feedback</strong> - ask your users what they think is missing or what could be improved. Then go create it! Giving your users a feature that they requested will wow them!</li>
</ul>
