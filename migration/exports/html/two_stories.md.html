<p>Like any other startup, we go through ups and downs. However, we try to
keep a positive energy, and you, my friends, contribute to that by sending your love,
support, and thanks everyday. Above all, you inspire us with stories of how
our product helped you learn, teach, and even develop a new skill to land a
better job.</p>
<p>Today I’d like to share with you two stories from two Replers: Ruslan a software
developer from Scotland, and Mark a math teacher from Houston.</p>
<h2>Landing a self-driving job</h2>
<p>Ruslan (<a href="https://repl.it/@kuddai">@kuddai</a>), a Physics Major, wanted to land
a job in doing software engineering. So he spent a lot of time practicing coding
using Repl.it and eventually was able to land a new job software
engineering job in the cutting edge field of self-driving! Here is him telling
the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I was doing my M.S. in Informatics at University of
Edinburgh, I realized that I lacked practice in coding interviews because my
first major is in Physics. During my preparation (“Cracking coding interview”,
“Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick”, hackerrank, etc.) I needed some general place
to store my solutions for coding exercises.  Eventually, I have chosen repl.it
because:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It is interactive. I can store my test cases as well, and use them
for various algorithms (like for all kinds of sorting)</li>
<li>It is accessible in browser so I could easily switch between library computer and my laptop</li>
<li>Ability to search past repls which is useful for spatial repetition.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was invited for the interview at Yandex, my past repls allowed me to repeat a
lot of topics in a very short amount of time. And after a couple of interview
rounds I was selected as software developer by selfdriving team.  Appreciate
that you added ability to use custom libraries in python (numpy repls are
really handy).</p>

<h2>Teaching low-income high-achieving students</h2>
<p>Mark (<a href="https://repl.it/@mrschmidt">@mrshcmidt</a>) is a computer science student at
the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, he spent the summer teaching
programming to 7th and 8th graders help them get into college. Both Mark and his
students used Repl.it to build projects using Python and Python turtle. Here is
Mark telling the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This summer I was a teaching fellow at Breakthrough Houston — a program that
aims to help low-income high-achieving students get into college. I worked
with 7th and 8th graders, teaching math as my core subject and an elective
computer science class. None of my students had any programming experience
going in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Repl.it enabled and empowered me as a teacher — I didn’t have to
worry about pre-installing any software, or worry about jumping through hoops
to get everyone setup. It was truly painless, and my students loved the
class. We learned some Python basics through lessons and challenge
problems. We spent the last week using the Python turtle module to make art
using their programming skills. I was so incredibly impressed with what they
made, and I just wanted to share it with you.</p>

<p>Ruslan and Mark are only two among the thousands who use Repl.it everyday and are very
passionate about programming -- so if you have your own story that you want share, as always,
we&#39;d love to <a href="mailto:contact@repl.it">hear</a> from you!</p>
