<p>We&#39;re excited to announce the Replit summer hackathon! What you&#39;ll be building: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/alexa-skills/b?ie=UTF8&node=13727921011">Amazon Alexa skills</a>!</p>
<p>Using the power of Replit, you can easily build and host a fully functional Alexa skill. Something important to note is that you don&#39;t need to have a physical Alexa-enabled device to build skills. There is a great simulator in the developer console and a downloadable app for your phone.</p>
<p>To start building right away, check out <a href="https://blog.replit.com/replexa">our tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3>What should I build?</h3>
<p>We will judge the projects based on usefulness. How would you use your Alexa device at home? Is there anything interesting that would make your life slightly easier? Bonus points for creativity. :)</p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>You must build an Alexa skill</li>
<li>It must be hosted on Replit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submitting your skill</h3>
<p>Submit your skill to <a href="https://Alexa-submission-site.sorenatreplit.repl.co">the submission site</a> by August 31st at 11:59 PM PT! Make sure you also post your repl to <a href="https://replit.com/apps/alexa">apps</a> and add the #alexa tag!</p>
<h3>Prizes</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we are going to give out 20~ Alexa units (Echo dot, Echo frames, Echo show, etc). If you&#39;re in the top 3 submissions, you will also receive a cash prize. 1st place will receive $3,000, 2nd will get $2,000, and 3rd will get $1,000.</p>
<p>Judging will take place during the first week of September, and winners will be announced during the second week.</p>
