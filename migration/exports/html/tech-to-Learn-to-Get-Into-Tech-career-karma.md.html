<h3>Node.js</h3>
<p>While the underlying language used by the developer when utilizing Node.js is JavaScript, it&#39;s a little different in that it&#39;s a technology that allows JavaScript to be used <em>everywhere</em>. <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-back-end-development/">Backend development</a> becomes an easier transition with Node.js when the frontend developers are using JavaScript as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/learn-node-js/">Learn Node</a> by becoming proficient in JavaScript fundamentals and how Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) works. Being knowledgeable about how the internet works in general will prove very useful in Node Development.</p>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>Python is one of the leading programming languages that is in-demand in 2020. It&#39;s a language that works really well for data science, machine learning, game development, and web development.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Most popular with companies that are primarily not run in the cloud, Java is the &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; language. Basically this means that an application that uses Java can be run on any system that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
<p>Currently, Java is used extensively in mobile development on the Android platform although Kotlin is starting to gain steam due to an ongoing dispute between <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/google-llc-v-oracle-america-inc/">Oracle and Google</a> that is currently being presented before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-code-in-java/">Learn Java</a> if you would like to become an Android developer for existing projects or work for companies who have not yet transitioned to the cloud.</p>
<h3>Angular.js</h3>
<p>Angular is the most in-demand JavaScript framework around at this moment. Companies who have not made the transition to React or who have not opted to use React most likely use Angular if they are involved in any sort of web development.</p>
<p><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/why-use-angularjs/">Learn Angular</a> if you would like to have a second JavaScript framework/library in your pocket that is <em>not</em> React. It may help to keep you competitive when applying for jobs if you know more than one JavaScript framework/library.</p>
<h3>C#</h3>
<p>According to its <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/">docs</a>, C# is an &quot;<em>elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>C# can be used to create almost anything but is particularly strong at building Windows desktop applications and games. <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-learn-c-sharp/">Learn C#</a> if you&#39;re interested in game development or Windows desktop application development.</p>
<h3>Swift</h3>
<p>Swift is Apple&#39;s update to the aging Objective-C language and is used for iOS development. Swift is highly readable, efficient, and can work for both client-side and server-side development.</p>
<p>If your goal is to work on Apple products, <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/how-to-learn-swift/">learning Swift</a> should be a priority.</p>
<h2>Average Salaries</h2>
<p><a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/junior-front-end-developer-salary/">Average salary</a> for a front-end web developer who develops web sites using HTML and CSS range from $54,000 to $90,000 a year.</p>
<p>If you combine HTML/CSS and JavaScript to be a <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/what-is-a-front-end-developer/">frontend web developer</a>, your salary will increase. In fact, your average salary will increase in relation to the specialty: frontend developers and <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/full-stack-developer/">full-stack developers</a> all carry their own responsibilities and as such have different <a href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/front-end-back-end-full-stack-developers/">rates of pay</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, the developers who create the logic to make apps functional are paid more. That means that Node, Python, and Java developers will typically be paid a little more than someone who creates a frontend using HTML and CSS. Adding a JavaScript framework or library to your job description adds a bit to your salary as well.</p>
