<p>Today, we&#39;re excited to introduce
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29">lint</a> support for Python3.
Where previously you had to run your code, look at the console for an error,
find the line number of the error and then find that line in your editor. Now,
we&#39;ll show you errors and potential mistakes live as you type!</p>

<p>This is powered by <a href="https://www.pylint.org/">pylint</a>, so in addition to obvious
errors like syntax errors, pylint will point out potential programmer mistakes
like unused variables, redefnining builtins and many more!</p>
