<p>One of the challenges of adding new functionality to any interface is balancing discoverability with visual clutter. We&#39;ve written before about how a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/clui">universal command bar</a> can be a great way to expose features without overloading the UI with buttons. This pattern already works well for us in our mobile interface, so now we&#39;re bringing it to desktop! Here&#39;s a demo of what it looks like:</p>

<p>The new command bar replaces our old shortcuts and file switcher modal. Just like before, you can use keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + P to switch files, Cmd/Ctrl + K to bring up all the options, etc) to interact with it. As we add more commands, power users will be able to have a keyboard centric experience while beginners can learn about features by exploring the different options.</p>
<p>Among the new features introduced in the updated command bar is Search! Search indexes the contents of every file in your project (with the exception of hidden files such as <code>node_modules</code> and anything in your <code>.gitignore</code>) and allows you to see every instance of a query across every file in your repl. From there, you can scroll through the results, see which line and file they appear in, and select a result to navigate directly to that line in the code like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/commandbar/search.gif" alt="Demo of Search"></p>
<p>You can access Search via Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F or by bringing up the command bar and typing “search”.</p>
<p>We&#39;re still thinking about the best way to surface these commands. Although keyboard shortcuts are the fastest way to use the command bar, they&#39;re notoriously underused and hard to discover. In the future, we&#39;ll likely add a dedicated button that opens the command bar directly. In addition, other primary actions can expose a way to open the command bar prefilled with a command (like Cmd/Ctrl + P opens the command bar directly in the &quot;find&quot; command).</p>
<p>Open up a repl and give it a try!</p>
