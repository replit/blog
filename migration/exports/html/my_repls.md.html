<p>People use Repl.it in a variety of ways; some use it for building and shipping
applications, while others use it for working on homework, and many others use
it as a quick prototyping/experimentation tool. Supporting all these use cases
(and more) is something we care a lot about, but up until now there wasn&#39;t an
easy way to, for example, quickly go back to a project that you continue to work
on every day.</p>
<p>Today we&#39;re excited to announce some of the changes that we&#39;ve
been testing for the past couple of weeks. Going to <a href="https://repl.it/repls">&quot;my repls&quot;</a> the
first thing you&#39;ll notice is a big &quot;Continue coding&quot; section with the projects
that we think you might want to go back and work on.</p>

<h2>Starring</h2>
<p>Additionally, you can now star repls, so it&#39;s easy to go back to them!</p>

<h2>Quick repl creation</h2>
<p>Repl.it users usually code in 1-3 languages, but up until now you had to go to
the full list of languages every time you wanted to create a new repl.
For that, we&#39;ve added a button that expands to include your three top-most used
languages.</p>

<h2>Infinite load</h2>
<p>Paging can be clunky and slow; it&#39;s much easier just to scroll.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We&#39;re not done yet; there&#39;s a lot more left to be desired. Look out for a new
and improved search bar. But for now, if you have any feedback, we&#39;d love to
<a href="https://repl.it/feedback">hear it</a>!</p>
