<p>On the weekend of July 21st, we sponsored and attended the Midwest&#39;s largest high school hackathon, Hack Chicago!</p>

<p>The event started out with an opening ceremony where people arrived and got a chance to hear from sponsors (including us).</p>

<p>After the opening ceremony ended, people either broke off to their teams or stuck around for the team forming activity. Once everyone was in teams and starting their preparations, it was time for workshops!</p>

<p>The first workshop was on making your first website using HTML and CSS. What&#39;s pretty cool is that this workshop was done on Repl.it!</p>

<p>One of the teams used Repl.it to host a Node.js server and created a mobile application that would allow people with down syndrome to connect with new friends</p>

<p>Another team used Google Maps and local crime data to generate a heat map to highlight areas that had more frequency of crimes than others</p>

<p>The team we gave our prize to for the best hack on Repl.it made a blockchain blogging platform where they stored users&#39; posts on the IPFS protocol</p>
