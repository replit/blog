<p>Earlier this week we introduced <a href="haskell">Haskell support</a>. And now, as promised,
we&#39;re continuing to add more functional languages. So today we&#39;re excited to introduce
<a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. A Lisp dialect that runs on top of the Java
Virtual Machine with a focus on immutability. [](preview end)</p>
<p>You can give it a try right now at
<a href="https://repl.it/languages/clojure">repl.it/languages/clojure</a>. And as always
here&#39;s a gif of what you can expect:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/DKr1F56VNgGNa.gif" alt="clojure"></p>
<p>This is built on top of the Clojure&#39;s
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">NRepl</a> server so you should be able to
get the native behavior you expect from a Clojure REPL. Please let us know if we
can make it better.</p>
