<p>Our first <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ventures">Replit Ventures</a> was a tremendous success. </p>
<p>Some of our teams were accepted into the best startup accelerators in the world while others had $1mm+ funding offers from top VCs.</p>
<h3>Before The Program</h3>
<p>Before joining Replit, <a href="https://twitter.com/roodsoren">I</a> was working on <a href="https://blog.replit.com/blubbr">my fintech startup</a>, Blubbr. After a few small successes, Amjad reached out and asked me to write a guest blogpost (our product was built on Replit).</p>

<p>We then started brainstorming ideas about how we can help other startups on Replit. After I told him I wanted to take a gap quarter (I hated online school), he asked me if I wanted to join the team and help other startups go to market. This is how Replit Ventures was born.</p>
<h3>Launch</h3>
<p>My first day at Replit was April 5, 2021. We launched Replit Ventures on April 13th. I wrote a <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ventures">blogpost</a> detailing the program and our <a href="https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1382015913394724864?s=20">launch Tweet</a> went viral (Thanks Jack Dorsey for the RT).</p>

<p>People were applying within minutes of the launch. Our application deadline was set for April 23rd. In only 10 days, over 400 teams had applied to the program.</p>
<h3>Application Pool Diversity</h3>
<p>We opened our application up <em>globally</em>. There were no limits on age, location, or timezone. (Bitcoin enables borderless and frictionless payments). Because of this, I think it&#39;s safe to say that we had one of the most diverse application pools ever seen in an incubator. Our applicants included both teenage hackers in India and Senior SWE&#39;s at FANG companies. (The younger entrepreneurs were always more innovative btw)</p>

<h3>Picking Teams</h3>
<p>We spent a lot of time picking the teams. This is one of those things that&#39;s &quot;more of an art than a science&quot;. HUGE shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/ykdojo">YK</a> for helping me go through all of the applications - this took a really long time. We selected 6 teams to join us: 5 startups and 1 nonprofit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slip.so">Slip</a> - Platform for building and selling programming courses</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/kobra">Kobra</a> - Visual programming language for machine learning</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/petcode">PetCode</a> - Smart pet tag for smarter pet care</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/nisawa">Nisawa</a> - Fast and reliable delivery service platform based in Rwanda, Africa</li>

<li>DogeMail - Innovative email client that uses Replit authentication (still building)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Program Starts</h3>
<p>After our kick-off call, the teams got to work right away. We paired each team with 1-2 mentors and hosted weekly meetings with some incredibly inspiring people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tabish Gilani: Ex-Growth @ Google, Growth PM @ Replit</li>
<li>Sergei Chestakov: Ex-SWE @ Google, SWE @ Replit</li>
<li>Haya Odeh: Co-founder @ Replit</li>
<li>Austen Allred: Founder @ <a href="https://lambdaschool.com">LambdaSchool</a></li>

</ul>
<img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/rv0/image_3.png" alt="chat" width="100%" style="width:100%"/>

<p>Teams usually met with their mentors once a week to discuss progress and go over any goals that they had.</p>
<h3>Launch Week</h3>
<p>After only a month of hard work, some of the teams decided to launch their products to the world. Here are links to some of the launches:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kobra">Kobra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tech-roulette">Execute Big</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/petcode">PetCode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/nisawa">Nisawa</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Some Highlights</h3>
<p>We can&#39;t share <em>all</em> of the highlights just yet. There are a few VC deals still being worked out. ;)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/roodsoren/status/1392247909874159617?s=20">I tweeted about Kobra</a> on May 11th. The tweet performed well and the ML community got pretty excited. On the 13th, someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27135573">posted about Kobra</a> on Hacker News and it was at the top all day.</p>
</li>
<li><p>During our program, PetCode was featured on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryjuetten/2021/05/13/managing-pets-with-tech-crowdfunding-petcode/?sh=3007565978ce">Forbes</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/nisawa">Nisawa Blogpost</a>: &quot;Our set goal coming into Replit Ventures was to grow our weekly deliveries at 15% week over week i.e. from 96 to 167 weekly deliveries after four weeks. In the end, <strong>we grew our weekly deliveries to 251 with an average weekly growth rate of 27.2% entirely through word of mouth.</strong>&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>PetCode launched a brand new premium plan. 50% of their customers converted to paid subscription increasing lifetime customer value as well as average order value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More than 800 participants signed up for Execute Big&#39;s <a href="https://techroulette.xyz">Tech Roulette</a> (and rolling!), and among them 450+ are under 21. They come from 60+ countries around the world and covered 35+ states in the U.S.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>Because of the program&#39;s success, VC firms have reached out wanting to invest in the ventures program alone. It is possible that the next iteration of Replit Ventures is <em>very</em> different. (more $ involved)</p>
<p>We&#39;re taking a short break to make the program better and work on other partnerships. Stay tuned for more details soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have any questions about how you can make your application as strong as possible for the next cohort, reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/roodsoren">SÃ¸ren</a> on Twitter or email <a href="mailto:soren@replit.com">soren@replit.com</a>. I&#39;m always happy to chat and answer questions.</p>
