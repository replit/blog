<p>At Replit, we have created a general purpose computing environment that anyone can use to run whatever programs they want, and access whatever services they want. You can run almost any type of software in a repl, including <a href="https://replit.com/@UniqueOstrich18/MacOSX">Mac OS</a>, <a href="https://replit.com/@mattiselin/C64?v=1">a Commodore 64 emulator</a>, <a href="https://replit.com/@programmeruser/DOOM-1993-nix-version?v=1">DOOM</a>, or even a web browser.</p>
<p>While this is powerful, it poses a few problems for us. There are some types of programs, like cryptocurrency miners and spam bots, that either use too many resources or damage the community as a whole, and as a result we can&#39;t allow them.</p>
<p>This is especially important considering that a substantial portion of users on Replit are teenagers, many of whom use Replit at school or under parental supervision. We want to continue giving everyone computing superpowers, while still finding a way to protect our users from inappropriate content.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why, starting this week, we are blocking all internet access to adult content and malware. That means if you run a web browser on Replit, you won&#39;t be able to access any objectionable or NSFW websites.</p>
<p>How does it work? We did this by enabling the use of <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/">Cloudflare&#39;s family-friendly DNS resolver</a> by default in all user repls. Visit their website for more information on this resolver and the type of content it blocks.</p>
<p>Using Replit as a proxy to bypass school or parental filters violates our <a href="https://replit.com/site/terms">Terms of Service</a>. We actively shut down repls that do this, with both automated tools and manual intervention.</p>
<p>This also means that schools using Replit are compliant with any legal requirements to filter internet content. Schools that previously blocked <code>*.repl.co</code> (<a href="https://docs.replit.com/teams/it-administrators-toolkit">details</a>) to filter all internet content can now unblock it and allow unrestricted access to all of Replit. All objectionable and NSFW content will be blocked by default.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a challenge to run one of the largest providers of free compute in the world, but we believe this is a crucial service to empower the next generation of programmers, and we want to make sure we do it right.</p>
