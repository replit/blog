<p>Terminals make it hard to copy things: Selecting text works differently to what people are used to, and <code>^C</code> aborts the current program. Links are hard to use.</p>
<p>Now you can click on links in the repl.it terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/terminal-links/terminal-links-intro.png" alt="An example of links in terminal being clickable"></p>
<p>It&#39;s as simple as starting a repl and printing a URL to the terminal.</p>
<p>This is super helpful with languages like Rust, which often print URLs in error messages to help you debug and learn.</p>

<p>This also works on repl.run, where you can <a href="https://repl.it/talk/announcements/BetaExplorers-Announcing-replrun-publish-your-terminal-apps-as-websites/7802">publish terminal apps as websites</a>. As an example, here&#39;s the repl.it blog available on repl.run <a href="https://terminalblog.arnavbansal.repl.run/">as a terminal website</a>, written in python:</p>

<p>Now your terminal apps can link to anything on the web!</p>
