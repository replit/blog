<p>You can now register your team to enter the <a href="https://repl.it/jam">programming language jam</a>! In addition to setting up your team you can start brainstorming ideas, but we ask you to wait until the 10th before you start hacking. </p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a team, join our <a href="https://repl.it/discord">Discord</a> and we&#39;ll help you find one. </p>
<p>Please follow these steps to register your team:</p>
<h2>Sign up for Repl.it</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re not signed up yet, please do that first. It&#39;s free and can be done in a couple of minutes. <a href="https://repl.it/signup">Sign up</a>.</p>
