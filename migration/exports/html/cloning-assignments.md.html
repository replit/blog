<p>You can now copy and clone an assignment from one classroom to another!  Many teachers have requested this feature, and we are happy to announce that it has been released!</p>
<p>Read on to see it in action.</p>
<p>Cloned assignments will carry over the code, files, instructions, automatic test cases, and model solutions.  The newly cloned assignment will appear in your destination classroom as a draft.</p>
<p>You can find the option for cloning an assignment by clicking on the three dots next to an assignment:</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/clone-assignment-option.png" alt="cloning assignments on replit"></p>
<p>A list of valid destination classrooms (including the one you are currently in) will appear.  This means that you can use this functionality to duplicate an assignment within a classroom.  You can only clone assignments into a classroom of the same programming language.</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/clone-assignment-choose.png" alt="cloning assignments into classroom"></p>
<p>You should now be able to see the assignment under &quot;Drafts&quot; in the chosen classroom!</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy this feature!  As always, we welcome feedback over at our <a href="https://repl.it/feedback">feedback boards</a></p>
