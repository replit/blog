<p>*<em>Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access <a href="https://replit.com/teams-for-education">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>We&#39;ve been hearing from our teacher community that despite school closings they want to continue teaching their students remotely. Luckily Repl.it was designed to be remote-first and will be a perfect tool for this.  We have two products that serve different remote modes:</p>
<h3><a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></h3>
<p>Real-time collaboration. You can invite your entire class into a repl to follow along or even collaborate all together. To that end, we&#39;re increasing the number of free collaborators on the free plan to 50 users!</p>

<h3><a href="https://repl.it/site/classrooms">Classroom</a></h3>
<p>Create small programming tasks for your students, give them feedback, and track their progress. </p>
