<p>Our <a href="https://replit.com/site/pricing">Hacker plan</a> has always been a great choice if you need more powerful repls. In addition to benefits like private repls, more storage, and <a href="https://blog.replit.com/alwayson">always on</a>, the Hacker plan gives all of your repls 4x the CPU and RAM compared to those in our free plan.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, even 4x is not enough. Whether you&#39;re building a <a href="https://blog.replit.com/fig">new Terminal</a> or <a href="https://blog.replit.com/native-graphics-love">playing Doom</a>, you could blow past those resource limits pretty quickly. That&#39;s why today we&#39;re excited to announce Boosts!</p>

<p>Boosts are a new addition to our Hacker plan that allow you to make your repls even faster. Boosted repls come with 4 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM which is double the resources of standard Hacker repls (and 8x more than free repls). As of today, we&#39;re including 5 free boosts as part of the Hacker plan. However, boosts can also be purchased on a free plan using <a href="https://replit.com/cycles">Cycles</a>.</p>
<p>To boost your repl, simply click on your repl&#39;s title to bring up the repl info card and click the &quot;Add boost&quot; button underneath the always on toggle like so:</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice the difference immediately if you&#39;re running a graphics or CPU intensive repl like this:</p>

<p>Hacker initially provides 5 free boosts but you can go beyond this 5 repl limit and add boosts to a free plan account with <a href="https://replit.com/cycles">Cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, you&#39;ll even be able to choose from a number of machines with arbitrarily high resource limits.</p>
<p>We hope this makes it easier to build faster and more complex apps on Replit. Happy hacking!</p>
