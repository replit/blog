<h2>FAQs 🤷🏻‍♂️</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Who&#39;s running the program?</strong></p>
<p>Hi 👋🏻, I&#39;m <a href="https://twitter.com/roodsoren">Soren</a>. I joined the team because I want to help other Replit entrepreneurs take their products to market. I&#39;m one of the co-founders of <a href="https://blog.replit.com/blubbr">Blubbr</a>, a fellow Replit startup.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to give equity to Replit Ventures to participate in the incubator?</strong></p>
<p>You won&#39;t have to give up any equity since this is still an experimental program. As Replit Ventures grows and we feel it&#39;s adding a lot of value, we&#39;ll revisit this question.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to build my entire application in Replit?</strong></p>
<p>While it&#39;s strongly encouraged that your team does at least the prototyping in Replit, this is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many teams will be accepted for the first cohort?</strong></p>
<p>For the first cohort, we will accept 4 startups and 1 new nonprofit.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When is the application deadline?</strong></p>
