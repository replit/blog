<p>We recently made it possible to <a href="python-import">import</a> any package from
PyPi. However, people who missed the announcement didn&#39;t know this was
possible. There was also no good way to search and explore packages.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why today we&#39;re excited to introduce a package search widget.
You&#39;ll be able to search for any python package without leaving the programming
environment.</p>
