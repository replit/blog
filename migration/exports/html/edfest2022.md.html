<p>Anyone else hearing &quot;School&#39;s out for Summer&quot; lyrics in your head when they read that?! Students may be out of session, but Replit has three days worth of reasons for educators to be in session!</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://join.replit.com/edfest2022">Replit&#39;s first educator-focused conference</a>, EdFest, on July 20-22, 2022. Come for one day, two, or all three. This conference is fully virtual, 100% free, and full of opportunities to earn professional development credits. Where else do you get a chance to &quot;geek out&quot; about teaching programming with the other cool kids?</p>
<h2>Interested in connecting with other educators across the globe (and win a free meal)?</h2>
<p>Join us on July 20 for demos + dinner. Who say&#39;s virtual conferences can&#39;t include a mixer? Offered at various times to accommodate different time zones, educators have the chance to participate in lightning round demos to show off tricks, hacks, and tips with Replit and teaching computer science. </p>
<p>And if that is not enough, we will have a special message from <a href="https://twitter.com/mkapor?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Mitch Kapor</a>. Oh, and did we mention, we will randomly gift participants with gift cards for dinner? Head to the <a href="https://join.replit.com/edfest">schedule on the registration page</a> and add the time that works best for you to your calendar, bring your lighnting round demo to share, and order your dinner! See, there really is such a thing as a free meal!</p>
<h2>Prefer to collaborate through workshops and demos?</h2>

Ready for more engaging learning like this? On July 21 from 10:00-2:00 pm PDT (don&#39;t worry everything will be recorded to rewatch later), come ready to dive into sessions about pedagogy, curriculum creation, equity in learning, engaging unmotivated learners, and so much more!

<h2>Need a side hustle this summer that allows you to create?</h2>
<p>Feeling inspired after all those sessions on July 21? Day three of Replit EdFest is for you. Introducing our Mini Curriculum Jam. Here is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a &quot;mini unit&quot; using Teams for Education consisting of one project. You pick the language and the topic.</li>
<li>Utilize project solutions, input/output testing, or whatever strikes your fancy.</li>
<li>Focus on a subject you teach, a language you love or create something totally out of the box.</li>
<li>Create a 5 minute or less video (Loom is a free resource for this) introducing the theme of your unit, objectives, goals, and give a preview of your project.</li>
<li>Submit your video and project link by midnight PDT on July 22, 2022.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our panel of judges will choose three submissions they want to see turned into a full unit/curriculum. These winners will get funded to finish their their work and be promoted on Replit&#39;s <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum">Curriculum Hub</a>!</p>
<p>Wait there&#39;s more! Everyone who participates will gain access to all the projects submitted so everyone leaves with inspiring starter code and ideas. There will also be opportunity to join discussions throughout the day!</p>
<p>Join the Curriculum Jam starting July 1. Keep on an eye on your email for more details.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, we will have educator specific swag in our <a href="https://shop.replit.com">ReplShop</a> for purchase. See you <a href="https://join.replit.com/edfest2022">July 20</a> for an epic party!</p>
