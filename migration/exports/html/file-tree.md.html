<p>Sometime in 2016 we in introduced the concept of &quot;files&quot; to Repl.it, you would click add file and a tab would appear on your Repl. As simple repls grew into full fledged applications and websites tabs started getting ugly and hard to manage.</p>
<p>Moreover, tabs undersold and misrepresented how we deal with files. Your files live in an actual file-system in a Linux machine. For example, you can <a href="https://repl.it/site/blog/file-updates">create and manipulate files from within your code</a>!.</p>
<p>After some design iterations we decided to forgo of tabs completely and stick to a file explorer or a file tree. Now you can view your files in a simple file tree that also includes folders.</p>

<p>We plan on improving the explorer in the future, but for now it has all the basic functionalities that you&#39;d need.</p>
