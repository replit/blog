<p>The inaugural tutorial jam has come to an end! Our wonderful Replit community shipped some fantastic learning experiences! Contestants were tasked with building a learning Repl using <a href="https://building-templates.davidatreplit.repl.co/">our new <code>.tutorial</code> functionality</a>, including using the new floating video pane, just like we&#39;ve used on <a href="http://join.replit.com/python">100 Days of Code</a>!</p>
<h2>Third Place</h2>

<h3><a href="https://replit.com/@MattDESTROYER/Intro-to-JS">Intro to JS by MattDESTROYER</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/tutorial-jam/image_10.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Intro to Javascript - how is that innovative, you might ask? Well - take a look? This tutorial really impressed the judges because the entirety of the exercises are graded and fed-back on <em>in a web view!</em> That means when you try and answer a question it will prompt you with improvements immediately.</p>
<p>This really raised the bar for what&#39;s possible in a tutorial, much more engaging than just <strong>another</strong> tutorial, this entry from MattDESTROYER really destroyed the competition.</p>
<h2>Second Place</h2>

The silver award brought in a $500 prize and this lovely shiny jpg of an award.</p>
<h3><a href="https://replit.com/@hogesonline/FlappyBrick">Flappy Brick by hogesonline</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/tutorial-jam/image_11.png" alt="image">
Sometimes things are just fun. This tutorial is fun. Fantastic use of both the video and tutorial panes with truly engaging content in both. And you actually build something substantial and meaningful with the power of PyGame means that this stood above the competition in terms of pure pedagogy.</p>
<p>Hogesonline has done a fantastic job here of taking a concept that is often difficult to teach and making it accessible and fun.</p>
<h2>First Place</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/tutorial-jam/gold.jpg" alt="Gold Award">
Our solid gold award wins a cool $750 and this beautiful award image, as well as the ability to slap &#39;Award winning&#39; on their twitter bioâ€¦ although that&#39;s true of the other two awards. This one is gold.</p>
<h3><a href="https://replit.com/@ApolloCrew6/Sorting-Algorithms-Bubble-Merge-and-Insertion">Sorting Algorithms - Bubble, Merge and Insertion by ApolloCrew6</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/tutorial-jam/image_13.png" alt="image">
As a Computer Science teacher I find sorting algorithms to be something fun to teach, but it&#39;s difficult to convey such an abstract concepts of sorting in different ways to learners. Here AppoloCrew6 has hacked the floating video pane to instead be a floating <em>live website</em> pane, allowing learners to play around with live sorting algorithms displayed visually whilst learning the concepts.</p>
<p>As well as this the content of the tutorial is excellent and teaches the concept in a really neat and enjoable way, if you&#39;ve got a spare few minutes this week you could do worse than to spend it learning about sorting algorithms with the fun innovation on offer in the Repl.</p>
<h2>Special Mentions</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/tutorial-jam/special.jpg" alt="Special Mention Award"></p>
<p>Our special mention category was for those tutorials that taught something innovative, exciting or fun. They were notable but didn&#39;t quite hit the top three, they&#39;re still amazing though.</p>
<h3>Something Unexpected</h3>

<p>We really didn&#39;t expect to get a full on bash tutorial as part of the entries but here it is! A really common ask from new coders is &quot;just how do I use this shell?&quot; - well now you&#39;ve got somewhere to send them where they can experiment without destroying their own computers!</p>
