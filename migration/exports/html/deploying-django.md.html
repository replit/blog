<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a Python framework for building out full-fledged web applications. It‚Äôs loved by developers due to its <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/">battery-included philosophy</a> and comes preloaded with features you can use to rapidly develop your web application. </p>
<p>Authentication and authorization have been previously incorporated into Django, which means you can focus on writing your app because the basic web development functionality has already been done. </p>
<p>Deploying Django can be taxing due to the production environment varying from the development environment on your local machine forcing you to use different operating systems and system configurations. </p>
<p>Technology like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> can simplify this process. However, <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> simplifies the process even more by handling environment configuration and dependencies, which means less configuration on your end. </p>
<p>Replit also allows for real-time collaboration. You can access Replit on any platform that has an active internet connection, and you can edit your code and connect with other developers anytime and anywhere. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn why you should use Replit and how to deploy your Django project to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> You‚Äôll still want to do some advanced database configuration in order to make your application robust and secure. This additional configuration helps to make your application production ready.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Replit</h2>
<p>To get started, navigate to <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a> and create an account.</p>
<p>Once signed up, you‚Äôll be taken to the dashboard where you can create a new application.</p>
<p>Create an application by selecting the <strong>plus</strong> icon as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/hRnCZuL.png" alt="Replit dashboard"></p>
<p>Replit provides you with a base template to work with while using Django, so you don&#39;t have to start from scratch. </p>
<p>After clicking on the <strong>plus</strong> sign, a modal will appear where you can search for <code>Django App Template</code> and give the <code>repl</code> a name. If your Django project is already on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> you can import it from this same modal screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/3hq7fE1.png" alt="Replit create new application"></p>
<p>Click <code>Create Repl</code> and Replit will create a Django project and navigate you to the online code editor, where you can start hacking.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/zkW5fdJ.png" alt="Replit online code editor"></p>
<p>On the left section of the project page, you have the files and folder that have been created.   You also have the ability to create your file or folder, as is standard in most code editors. </p>
<p>The middle section has the code editor itself, where you can write your code and on the right, you have the output/shell/console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take note of the <code>.replit</code> file. This is very important once you want to deploy your application to the internet. If you imported your code through GitHub, you may need to manually add this file. This will be addressed later in the article.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Deploying Django</h2>
<p>Before you begin, the code must be written that will import to the required framework or library. In this case, the code has been written for you using the default <code>Django App Template</code>.</p>
<p>Replit deploys to a web server by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening to the port in order to start the server successfully. In this case, this step is taken completed for you with the <code>replit</code> file. </li>
<li>Then directly start the server and the application will be hosted automatically. When you click on the <strong>play</strong> button, the web application will appear with the domain Replit supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/S0DLo5T.png" alt="Replit starting the server"></p>
<p>Now you have successfully deployed Django to Replit and can share the domain, so others can view your application. </p>
<h3>Creating a Django Application</h3>
<p>After deploying to Django, it‚Äôs time to create the application. </p>
<p>Before you begin, you need to migrate your database, by running the <code>python manage.py migrate</code> in the <code>Shell</code>.</p>
<p>Then create a new Django application called <code>tasks</code> by running <code>python manage.py startapp tasks</code> in the <code>Shell</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/VSPR1gK.png" alt="Replit create a new app"></p>
<p>This will create a new folder called <code>tasks</code> with all the necessary files. </p>
<p>Include this code inside the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> array under the <code>mysite/settings.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>py
...
&#39;tasks.apps.TasksConfig&#39;,
</code></pre>
<p>Here, you are telling Django about the new application that was created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The server automatically reloads and reflects necessary changes, however, you can also refresh your browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, update the <code>mysite/urls.py</code> file, by adding the path below to the existing path:</p>
<pre><code>py
...
path(&quot;&quot;, views.index),
</code></pre>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to include the imports:</p>
<pre><code>py
from tasks import views
</code></pre>
<p>Next, update the <code>tasks/views.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>py
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return render(request, &quot;index.html&quot;, {})
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you need to create a new folder called <code>templates</code> inside the <code>tasks</code> application. Then create a new file called <code>index.html</code> inside <code>templates</code>. </p>
<p>Inside <code>index.html</code> add:</p>
<pre><code>html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Task Tracker&lt;/title&gt;

        &lt;link
            href=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;
            rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
            integrity=&quot;sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC&quot;
            crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;
        /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        {% csrf_token %}
        &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Tracker üìù&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;br /&gt;

            &lt;ul class=&quot;list-group&quot;&gt;
                &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item mb-2&quot;&gt;Wash the Car&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item mb-2&quot;&gt;Make the Bed&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item mb-2&quot;&gt;Walk the Dog&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;script
            src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js&quot;
            integrity=&quot;sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM&quot;
            crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;
        &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You have now added an application called <code>tasks</code> with a view function, template, and project URL to create a more presentable application. Refresh your browser and you should see the following screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/4ypICez.png" alt="Replit create a new app"></p>
<p>This application can be extended further to include database interactions.</p>
<h3>Importing from GitHub</h3>
<p>In most cases, you will have a Django application running on your local machine that you now want to host on Replit. </p>
<p>Replit allows you to import projects from GitHub. For demonstration purposes, you&#39;ll be importing <a href="https://github.com/Samuel-2626/django_replit">this Django application</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, start on the Replit homepage and click on the <strong>plus</strong> sign to create a new project. Select <code>Import from GitHub</code>, and you&#39;ll see the following screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/q3Ih7ZM.png" alt="Replit create a new app with GitHub 1"></p>
<p>Paste this inside the GitHub URL input field <code>https://github.com/Samuel-2626/django_replit</code> and finally, import using the <code>Import from GitHub</code> button. </p>
<p>Replit will now try to clone the repo and after, you&#39;ll be navigated to the code editor where you can start hacking and host the application. </p>
<p>In order to create a <code>.replit</code> file to help bootstrap your server, paste <code>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3000</code> by the left section under the <code>configure the run button</code> text.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/GGw5neX.png" alt="Replit create a new app with GitHub 2"></p>
<p>Before you click on the <strong>play</strong> button, paste the following code in the <code>replit_django_example/settings.py</code> file. This allows Django to successfully run in Replit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">X_FRAME_OPTIONS = &#39;*&#39;
</code></pre>
<p>Run the server by selecting the <strong>play</strong> button. You‚Äôll get a disallowed host. To solve this, copy your <code>request_url</code> and paste it in the <code>settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">ALLOWED_HOSTS = [ &#39;cb1a0754-b29b-4fef-a985-935aff18927d.id.repl.co&#39;]
</code></pre>
<p>You have now successfully deployed Django to Replit using GitHub as the intermediary.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Replit is an online integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used in a variety of ways. In this guide, you were taught how to host Django to Replit in order to take advantage of all the features Replit has to offer, like less configuration, making deploying apps a seamless event. </p>
<p>For serious applications, you‚Äôll have to use a more robust database other than the default <code>sqlite-3</code> and consider using a more friendly domain name.</p>
<p>Before deploying a production application to Replit, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/deployment/checklist/">official Django docs</a> to learn more. </p>
