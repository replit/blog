<p>As you use Repl.it more and more, you often find yourself frequently creating repls for quick testing.  On your repls dashboard, you can mark important repls by starring them - allowing you to quickly access them.  However, there was no way to surface your best work on your profile - users would have to sift through all your repls to find the one they were looking for - until now.</p>
<p>Do you have a game, project, or demo that you particularly proud of?  You can now pin up to five repls to the top of your profile, where they will be displayed first, before your other more recent repls.  You can pin and unpin repls from both your profile and your <a href="/repls">repls dashboard</a>.  Here&#39;s an example of how it might look:</p>
