<p>We&#39;re super excited to announce Replit Creates - a creative coding challenge taking place during the month of August. If you want to see what it&#39;s all about, check out the <a href="https://replit-creates.replit-community.repl.co/">Replit Creates website</a>!</p>
<h2>How do I participate?</h2>
<p>Each weekday, we&#39;ll provide you with prompts and resources to create something expressive rather than something functional. Most of these prompts will be intentionally open-ended to leave room for your interpretations, but each one comes with helpful links in case you need some inspiration.</p>
