<p>On Wednesday we announced <a href="https://repl.it/site/blog/scheduled-assignment">assignment scheduling</a>, and today we&#39;re releasing another date related feature—due dates. It&#39;s no secret that students can procrastinate, so sometimes it&#39;s useful to have deadlines for the assignments as a reminder.[](preview end)</p>
<p>Due date restricts students from submitting after a certain date/time. If you&#39;re feeling generous and want to give students another shot, just edit the assignment and update the due date.</p>

<p>As you can see in the image above, we had to swap a couple of things to fit this in. We moved the assignment name to the header—which you can edit, and placed the due date above the instructions.</p>
