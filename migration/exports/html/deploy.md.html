<p>Repl.it is becoming the platform where developers come to learn and
build. With <a href="hosting">web hosting</a> we also made it possible to host websites and
since then we&#39;ve seen an explosion of websites hosted on Repl.it. Today we&#39;re
going further by making it possible to deploy servers on Repl.it.</p>
<p>Just open a port, run your code, and that&#39;s it, it&#39;s deployed!</p>

<p>For our
<a href="/ibuiltthis/websites">90s website competition</a> I built this socket.io-based
chat hosted on Repl.it:
<a href="https://90s-chat--amasad.repl.co/">90s-chat--amasad.repl.co</a></p>
<p>Here is the repl for it:</p>

<p>This is an early beta release so we look to your <a href="/feedback">feedback</a> so we can improve it.</p>
