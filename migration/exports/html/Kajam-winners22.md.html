<h1>What’s Kajam?</h1>
<p>Kajam is Replit’s official game jam where members of our community build games, play games, and sometimes even win cash prizes for their games in the span of a single week! This year, from June 25th to July 2nd, Replit spiced things up with a grand prize of $10,000, category prizes of $5,000, and a new Crowd Pleaser prize of $1,000. The catch? The games had to meet the theme: SPICY! </p>
<p>During the jam, participants collaborated and got help from mentors on our <a href="https://replit.com/discord">Discord</a>, <a href="http://replit.com/community/kajam2022">audiences sampled and judged the games for themselves</a>, and some players even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLieFqTElnpVxUXI6OwBAJjOVvaPCP5TDM">documented their journeys!</a> </p>
<p>In the end, we received over 190 awesome submissions this year, battling to win the grand prize! But only one could beat the heat. Our judges (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PolyMars">PolyMars</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry">CodeWithHarry</a> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/metalandcoffee_">Metal and Coffee</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/aniakubow">Ania Kubow</a>, <a href="https://www.mindjoy.com/">MindJoy</a>, <a href="https://space55.xyz/">Tiga Wu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/LeeFlemingRepl/">Lee Fleming</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vimlark">Vimlark</a>) carefully reviewed each game to decide the ultimate spicy winners…</p>

<h2>Best Story - Frank&#39;s Adventure</h2>
<p><a href="https://replit.com/@quanuhs/Franks-Adventure">Frank&#39;s Adventure</a> follows the story of science-wannabe, Frank, who lives with his mother while he tries to get rich by selling his spicy peppers. Unfortunately, making spicy peppers isn’t as easy as it seems. The story in this game is a huge reason to play, enabled by the fantastic voice acting. The voice acting is so good it’s easy to overlook the quality artwork and entertaining gameplay loops. <a href="https://replit.com/@quanuhs/Franks-Adventure">Hear for yourself and help Frank get rich on spicy peppers!</a>

<h2>Most Polished - Deliverwing</h2>
<p>Deliverwing is a game by <a href="https://replit.com/@zekehernandez">@zekehernandez</a> two birds must deliver hot wings without spilling them. I (Nathan) had the privilege of playing this game in our closing ceremony, and I must admit it’s a lot more challenging than it seems at first. But Delivering isn’t just challenging, it is polished. Everything from the dialogue to the art to the controls and gameplay is pristine. If you’re looking for a challenging and satisfying game to play, <a href="https://replit.com/@zekehernandez/Deliverwing">give Deliverwing a try</a>.

<h2>Best Crowd Pleaser - Spicy War</h2>
<p>The Crowd Pleaser award was a new addition to this year&#39;s Kajam. To win this award participants not only had to build a game, they also had to create a popular TikTok or YouTube Short. We loved <a href="https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT">@CoderGautamYT</a>&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WHl7-EHYo64">video</a> for <a href="https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT/spicywario?v=1">Spicy War</a>. We liked it much that we made <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/QZhgyvziFqM">our own video</a> to announce the award! </p>
<h2>Grand Prize - SSSPICY</h2>
<p>The grandest of the prizes goes to <a href="https://replit.com/@torcado/SSSPICY">SSSPICY</a> by <a href="https://replit.com/@torcado">@torcado</a>! YAY!!! Once upon a big orange board, a hungry snake went looking for food, and stumbled upon a peculiar, spicy pepper. Help this snake eat all the peppers and get back to its home without getting launched off the board! </p>
<p>Judges loved how innovative, creative, and satisfying this game is. SSSPICY is a puzzle game which involves the controls of “snake” with puzzles vaguely calling back to the classic game Bloxor. The quality was unmatched, the puzzles were challenging, and we can’t wait to see what <a href="https://replit.com/@torcado">@torcado</a> makes next. <a href="https://replit.com/@torcado/SSSPICY">Block off a few hours on your schedule and get lost in SSSPICY!</a>!
