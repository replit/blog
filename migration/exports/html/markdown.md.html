<p>When our community members want to provide instructions within a repl,
the most common pattern we&#39;ve seen is in a <code>.txt</code> file, or as a code
comment. Users quickly figured out that while they could make markdown
files, there was no way to render it in a more readable format. Today,
that changes. We&#39;re happy to announce that you can now preview markdown
in repls!</p>
<h1>How to get Markdown Previews</h1>
<p>It&#39;s really simple to use - simply create a markdown file (a file with an
<code>.md</code> extension) and viola - you&#39;ll see a button to edit and preview in
the top right corner of the editor.</p>
<p>Feel free to edit your markdown file, and toggle back and forth between
preview mode and edit mode as much as you like!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog-images.amasad.repl.co/markdown-preview.gif" alt="markdown preview"></p>
<p>Opening a markdown file will show the preview by default, so you can use
this as a README for your repl, or to provide special instructions.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Aside from being able to preview markdown, we also support full syntax
highlighting for code blocks. It will be highlighted in the same theme
as the editor itself.</p>
<p>You can also copy code blocks by clicking on the copy icon in the
top-right corner of code blocks.</p>
<p>We have ideas for more features, but we&#39;d also like to hear from you.

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>Right now, markdown previews are only supported on Monaco, which we use
for non-mobile platforms. Mobile support is coming soon.</p>
<p>Since it&#39;s built right into the editor, we have ambitious ideas for how
it can be better integrated with the rest of the Repl.it experience.
One such example of a feature we want to see is the ability to import
a code block directly into a file. This would be especially helpful for
using markdown as tutorial instructions.</p>
<p>We&#39;d also like for files named <code>README.md</code> to be the default selected
file, if it exists, so users landing on your repl will see your README
first.</p>
<p>Got more ideas for us? We&#39;d love to hear them over on our
<a href="/feedback">feedback channels</a>!</p>
