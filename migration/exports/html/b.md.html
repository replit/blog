<p>Following our <a href="https://blog.replit.com/seriesa">Series A announcement</a> earlier this year, I&#39;m thrilled to announce that we raised <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/replit-remix-the-internet">Series B</a> financing from new and existing investors. This year alone we&#39;ve doubled our user base to reach <strong>10m+ users</strong>, tripled concurrent containers on our network, and grew traffic to sites and apps on the network by orders of magnitude. This is a major milestone for our team &amp; community.</p>

<p>Our <em>mission is to bring the next billion software creators online</em>. To advance towards this mission we will be investing in the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build the world&#39;s most <em>ubiquitous</em> programming environment. </li>
<li>Inspire creativity and generate value for creators through <em>community</em>.</li>
<li>Design simple yet scalable infrastructure <em>primitives</em> for the next generation of creators.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this speaks to you, consider <a href="https://replit.com/careers">joining our team</a>. At 40, we&#39;re still small with an outsized impact on the world. It&#39;s a perfect time to join.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of this, we&#39;re excited to expand our giving to the open-source projects that help us deliver on our vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/fcc">$100k to FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.replit.com/betting-on-nix">$25k to the Nix Foundation</a></li>
<li>$10k to the Rust Foundation</li>
<li>Recurring donations to projects including CodeMirror, Vite, Emmet, and many others</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ubiquity</h2>
<p>To reach a billion people we will build tools that scale the entire globe. Tools that anyone can use regardless of their <a href="https://blog.replit.com/codemirror-mobile">device</a> and which technology stack they prefer. In the next year expect Replit to become <a href="https://blog.replit.com/faster-repls">faster</a>, more <a href="https://blog.replit.com/codemirror-mobile">portable</a>, and able to run <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix">more and more software</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, we&#39;re excited to explore the future of <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1467571734316417025">AI-assisted coding</a> with a special emphasis on <a href="https://blog.replit.com/codex">code comprehension</a>.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>We wouldn&#39;t be here without our lovely community. They&#39;ve been invaluable partners in building and growing Replit and will be a big part of our future. To that end, we want to ensure that Replit is the best place for people to make meaningful connections <a href="https://blog.replit.com/collaborative-coding">around code</a>. A place to build, learn, and earn, together.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.replit.com/assets/apps-blog/apps-scroll-demo.gif" alt="apps"></p>
<p>We&#39;re also looking forward to investing directly in creators from our community through programs like <a href="https://blog.replit.com/rv0">Ventures</a>. More on this soon.</p>
<h2>Primitives</h2>
<p>Building on <a href="https://docs.replit.com/hosting/database-faq">DB</a>, <a href="https://docs.replit.com/hosting/authenticating-users-repl-auth">Auth</a>, and our compute infrastructure we want to continue investing in simple yet scalable components that let people build and compose software seamlessly. Our north star vision is to shorten the distance between idea and product to its absolute essence. By thinking of a good idea, you should be half the way towards realizing it. </p>
