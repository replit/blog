<p>On Monday, June 11th, we had our first Repl.it Meetup and it was super awesome!</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/replit-irl-6-11-18/talking.jpg?p=np" alt="replit meetup"></p>
<p>A bunch of Replers from teachers to students came to the Repl.it office to enjoy pizza, meet the team, chat with other Replers, and also spend some time coding in a mini hackathon where the prompt was to make the most overcomplicated &quot;Hello World&quot; program possible.</p>

<p>One of the coolest projects made at the meetup was a program that would take a font, generate a separate Python+Turtle program that would draw the text &quot;Hello World&quot; in that specified font, and then he presented the resulting Python program as being the elaborate &quot;Hello World&quot; program.</p>

<p>The code for generating the &quot;Hello World&quot; program itself is <a href="https://repl.it/@DavidLindes/repl-irl-gen-hello">here</a> and, if you&#39;re interested in seeing the other projects made, they were collected via commenting on our <a href="https://repl.it/ibuiltthis/repls/Replit-IRL/44944">I Built This post</a>.</p>
<p>We certainly enjoyed meeting some of our users as well as seeing everyone have a fun time hacking and we&#39;re planning for the next Repl.it IRL to be on July 11th!</p>
