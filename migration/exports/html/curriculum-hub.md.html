<p><em>Say hello to the Replit Curriculum Hub, your one-stop-shop for quality CS learning materials!</em></p>
<p>Since launching <a href="https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education">Teams for Education</a>, we&#39;ve met <a href="https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education-case-study">countless amazing educators</a>. From seasoned Computer Science instructors who need some ideas to spice up their classes to Social Studies teachers that are stepping in last-minute at their schools to teach programming. Whatever your experience, the Curriculum Hub was built by experienced educators across a variety of skills and learning environments to meet all kinds of learner needs. </p>
<p>With the Curriculum Hub, admins on Teams for Education accounts can quickly peruse projects, lesson plans, instructions, and tests, then plug them right into their own Teams. Curriculum Hub materials are designed to work as full units or as stand-alone projects to turnkey into your tried-and-true materials. </p>
<h3>We define Replit curriculum as:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creative</strong> Our curriculum prioritizes <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Python-Project-Based-Learning">project-based learning with open-ended prompts</a> to give students opportunities to learn real-world skills in ways that are personally meaningful to them.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative</strong> We wouldn&#39;t be Replit if we didn&#39;t put this on the list! We know that learners sometimes make the best teachers, so we&#39;ve offered plenty of ways for students to pair program, share out, and <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Intro-to-HTML-and-CSS">show off</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Accessible</strong> Projects on the Curriculum Hub are welcoming to newcomers and exciting to pros. Instructions are <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Python-for-GCSE">fun and interesting to read</a>, <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Learn-AI-with-Replit-Teachable-Machine">appeal to different kinds of learners</a>, and <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Intro-to-CS-with-Python-ICS3U">there are challenges to keep even the speediest coders engaged</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meet the Teachers</h3>

<p><strong>Toni Scullion</strong> is a computing science teacher and founder of <a href="https://dresscode.org.uk/">dressCode</a>, a non-profit charity aspiring to make a dent in the computing science gender gap. She is extremely passionate about teaching computing science and getting more young people into the subject, particularly more girls. Check out her fun and creative lessons on <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Intro-to-HTML-and-CSS">HTML and CSS</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Intro-to-SQL">SQL</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Colley</strong> is a computer science teacher from Manchester, UK and passionate PRIMM advocate.

<p><strong>Tucker Klutey</strong> teaches Computer Science at Alpha, a K-12 private school in Austin, TX. His teaching motto is &quot;learn at play&quot; which is probably why his unit on <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Learn-AI-with-Replit-Teachable-Machine">Image Recognition with Teachable Machine</a> is so exciting! </p>
<p><strong>David Morgan</strong> has been teaching Computer Science in British secondary schools for two decades and brings not only his expertise, but his excellent sense of humor to his <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Python-for-GCSE">Python for GCSE</a> unit. Get comfy and read these materials like a good book!</p>
