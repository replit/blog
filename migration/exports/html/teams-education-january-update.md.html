<p>*<em>Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access <a href="https://replit.com/teams-for-education">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello teachers, we hope your new year is off to a good start and your students have come back from the holidays engaged and excited to learn programming! If you&#39;ve been teaching with Replit for awhile, you know how committed we are to helping teachers create aha moments and inspire their students. To that end we&#39;ve been working hard to make Teams for Education the best CS education tool out there and want to share some updates.</p>
<p>After January 31st, we will end access to our legacy Classroom product. If you haven&#39;t tried <a href="https://repl.it/teams">Teams for Education</a> yet, now&#39;s the time! Teams for education is <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/privacyFAQs">FERPA/COPPA and privacy compliant</a> and has <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Projects">assignments</a>, <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/InputOutput">autograding</a> and other Classroom features you love, plus <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">real-time multiplayer collaboration</a>, <a href="https://docs.repl.it/Teams/Annotations">code conversations/annotations</a>, and more. <a href="https://repl.it/classroom-migration">Migrate your Classroom now for free.</a> (Note: you&#39;ll still be able to migrate/export your data after January 31st.)</p>
<p>We will be hosting several webinars over the next few weeks to provide basic training on the product and answer any of your questions. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUX-dkHWU8A">recording of our last webinar</a> in case you missed it. We&#39;d love to see you there!</p>
