<p>Replcraft is a library that allows you to automate parts of your base on a
Minecraft server using code, directly from a repl. Replcraft allows you to
get and place blocks, check for entities, move and craft items, read
redstone, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial will cover a number of small projects you can build using
Replcraft. If you&#39;d be interested in joining an official Replit community
Minecraft server, seeing more Minecraft-related content in the future, or you just
want to leave general feedback, you can do so by commenting on
<a href="https://replit.com/@LeeFleming/Automating-Minecraft-on-Replit#README.md">this repl</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Before you begin, you&#39;ll need a <a href="https://replit.com/login">Replit account</a> and a Minecraft account.
To get started, fork the <a href="https://replit.com/@LeeFleming/Replcraft#readme.md">Replcraft template</a> and join a Minecraft server
running the Replcraft plugin. Next, create a special <em>structure</em> made up of a frame
of iron blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/01_empty_5x5x5_structure.png" alt="A 5x5x5 structure"></p>
<p>After you&#39;re done building the structure, place a sign on the side with the lines
<code>REPL</code>, two blank lines, and your Minecraft username. Sneak-interact with the sign
to receive your token.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/02_structure_sign.png" alt="The contents of the sign on the structure"></p>
<p>You can click your token in chat to copy it. Paste your newly acquired token into a
<a href="https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/08-storing-secrets-and-history">secret</a> called <code>token</code>. You&#39;re now ready to go.</p>
<h2>Creating things</h2>
<p>You can now perform all sorts of actions from your repl. To start off, lets
place some blocks inside the structure. You&#39;ll need to provide the materials by
placing a chest directly adjacent to any part of your structure and filling it
with the required blocks. That chest is now considered part of the structure&#39;s
inventory, and the <code>setBlock(x, y, z, block)</code> method will pull from it as
necessary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ReplCraft = require(&#39;./lib/replcraft.js&#39;);
let client = new ReplCraft();

(async () =&gt; {
  await client.login(process.env.token);
  client.setBlock(0, 0, 0, &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;); // !
})();
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/03_5x5x5_with_cobble.png" alt="A block of cobblestone placed in the structure"></p>
<h3>Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>All coordinates are relative to your structure.
<code>(0, 0, 0)</code> is located in the northwest corner.</li>
<li>To figure out what block string to use, you can use the <code>getBlock(x, y, z)</code> method:<pre><code class="language-javascript">// ...
let block = await client.getBlock(0, 0, 0);
console.log(block);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><code>setBlock</code> will break any block already at the given coordinates and deposit
all dropped items into any available chest connected to the structure. An
alternative form of the API is also available to specify a specific chest
inside the structure to use:
<code>setBlock(x, y, z, block, sourceChestX, scy, scz, destinationChestX, dcy, dcz)</code>.</li>
<li>To break a block without placing a new one, you can use the <code>minecraft:air</code> psuedoblock:
<code>setBlock(0, 0, 0, &#39;minecraft:air&#39;)</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Watching for block updates</h2>
<p><code>getBlock</code> is useful, but what if we need to know about block changes
immediately? Replcraft provides a set of event-based and poll-based update
streams that you can subscribe to with the <code>watch</code> and <code>poll</code> methods. When a
subscribed block changes, the client will emit a <code>block update</code> event.</p>
<p>Lets use <code>poll</code> to efficiently gather lots of cobblestone:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// ...
client.poll(0, 0, 0);
client.on(&#39;block update&#39;, (cause, block, x, y, z) =&gt; {
  if (block == &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;) {
    // `air` is a special block that represents no block.
    // We can place it for its side effect of breaking any existing block.
    client.setBlock(0, 0, 0, &#39;minecraft:air&#39;);
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/04_cobblestone_miner.gif" alt="A cobblestone generator. The cobblestone disappears frequently."></p>
<p>Now whenever our cobblestone generator generates a new block, we can
immediately break it without having to constantly hit the API with <code>getBlock</code> or
<code>setBlock</code> requests. However, <code>watch</code> and <code>poll</code> come with some respective downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to API limitations, <code>watch</code> is only capable of catching certain
kinds of changes. It&#39;s useful for when you need to see a known-good
type of change fast.</li>
<li><code>poll</code> will catch all types of changes by constantly re-examining all
polled blocks. Repolling every single block would be slow, so only
one block is examined per tick. The more blocks you poll, the longer it
takes for you to be notified about changes to any individual block.
Note that <code>poll</code> can miss changes if a block is changed and then
changed back - for example, if we&#39;re replacing broken cobblestone
faster than we can check for it.</li>
<li>Using both together can be a powerful tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Checking for entities</h2>
<p>Another thing we can automate is checking for entities inside your region.
Maybe you have someone that you want to play a prank on: when they enter
your structure, it should trap them! Anybody else should be left alone, though.</p>
<p>Lets first conceal our structure so that they don&#39;t suspect a thing:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/05_concealed_structure.png" alt="A large structure with a hallway built into it"></p>
<p>Then, to figure out what blocks we&#39;ll need to place, lets run a utility script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">client.watchAll();
client.on(&#39;block update&#39;, (cause, block, x, y, z) =&gt; {
  console.log({ cause, block, x, y, z });
});
</code></pre>
<p>And then place some blocks:</p>
<pre><code>{ cause: &#39;place&#39;, block: &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;, x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }
{ cause: &#39;place&#39;, block: &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;, x: 1, y: 2, z: 1 }
</code></pre>
<p>Excellent. Let&#39;s prepare our trap and await our victim...</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ReplCraft = require(&#39;./lib/replcraft.js&#39;);
const sleep = ms =&gt; new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, ms));
(async () =&gt; {
  let client = new ReplCraft();
  await client.login(process.env.token);

  while(true) {
    let entities = await client.getEntities();
    let has_victim = entities.some(entity =&gt; {
      return (
        entity.type == &#39;PLAYER&#39; &amp;&amp; // Look for players...
        entity.name == &#39;eelblock&#39; &amp;&amp; // Named &quot;eelblock&quot;...
        entity.x &lt;= 1 // And then wait for them to get all the way inside
      )
    });
    if (has_victim) break; // We&#39;ve got him!
    await sleep(1000); // Nobody here, let&#39;s check again later...
  }

  // The trap is sprung!
  client.setBlock(1, 1, 1, &#39;minecraft:obsidian&#39; /* indestructible! */);
  client.setBlock(1, 2, 1, &#39;minecraft:obsidian&#39;);
})();
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/06_hallway_trapped.png" alt="A hallway blocked off with obsidian"></p>
<p>Curses! Foiled again!</p>
<p>Though it seems our trap isn&#39;t very useful after all.
They&#39;ve just teleported <code>/home</code> - oops!</p>
<h2>Listening for redstone</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>getEntities()</code> is an expensive API call! To make it cheaper, we
can utilize regular old pressure plates and redstone. <code>watch</code> is capable of
observing redstone-related block updates, which allows us to efficiently watch
redstone-enabled blocks such as a redstone lamp.</p>
<p>First, lets use our utility script again and place a redstone lamp:</p>
<pre><code>{ cause: &#39;place&#39;, block: &#39;minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=false]&#39;, x: 0, y: 0, z: 1 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/07_pressure_plate_lamp.png" alt="A pressure plate and a redstone lamp inside the concealed structure"></p>
<p>We can now <code>watch</code> that lamp, and take an action when something triggers the pressure plate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// ...
await client.watch(0, 0, 1);
client.on(&#39;block update&#39;, async (cause, block, x, y, z) =&gt; {
  if (block == &#39;minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]&#39;) {
    // Spring the trap! Or do other things!
  }
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Automatic crafting</h2>
<p>Lets automate some crafting. Replcraft provides the <code>craft(x, y, z, itemRef[])</code>
method which takes a destination for the crafted item and nine <em>item
references</em>. An item reference is an object of the form <code>{ x, y, z, index }</code>,
referring to the coordinates of the chest containing the ingredient and the slot
index in that chest. The list of item references must be nine nullable item
references long, and corresponds to a 3x3 crafting table grid.</p>
<p>In order to <em>find</em> item references, you can use the <code>getInventory(x, y, z)</code>
method, which returns an array of <code>{ index, type, amount }</code> describing the items
in a given container.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s our setup:
<img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/08_crafting_booth.png" alt="A structure containing three chests"></p>
<p>First of all, let&#39;s define some recipes. A quick word of warning: recipes
must <em>exactly</em> match their vanilla definitions, and can&#39;t be shifted around
like they can in a regular crafting table. Try moving the recipe to the left
or flipping it horizontally if you&#39;re having trouble getting it to work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let cobble = &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;;
let stick = &#39;minecraft:stick&#39;;
let recipes = {
  sword: [
    cobble, null, null,
    cobble, null, null,
    stick , null, null
  ],
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, describe where to find the items:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let items = {
  &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;: {
    location: [0, 0, 1],
    stacks: await client.getInventory(0, 0, 1)
  },
  &#39;minecraft:stick&#39;: {
    location: [0, 0, 2],
    stacks: await client.getInventory(0, 0, 2)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And now, put it all together. For each item, look up its ingredient in the
items table, do some quick math to make sure there&#39;s enough, then commit the
crafting operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ReplCraft = require(&#39;./lib/replcraft.js&#39;);
(async () =&gt; {
  let client = new ReplCraft();
  await client.login(process.env.token);

  let cobble = &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;;
  let stick = &#39;minecraft:stick&#39;;
  let tools = {
    sword: [
      cobble, null, null,
      cobble, null, null,
      stick , null, null
    ],
    pickaxe: [
      cobble, cobble, cobble,
      null  , stick , null  ,
      null  , stick , null
    ],
    shovel: [
      cobble, null, null,
      stick , null, null,
      stick , null, null
    ],
    axe: [
      cobble, cobble, null,
      cobble, stick , null,
      null  , stick , null
    ]
  };

  let items = {
    &#39;minecraft:cobblestone&#39;: {
      location: [0, 0, 1],
      stacks: await client.getInventory(0, 0, 1)
    },
    &#39;minecraft:stick&#39;: {
      location: [0, 0, 2],
      stacks: await client.getInventory(0, 0, 2)
    }
  }

  for (let [tool, ingredients] of Object.entries(tools)) {
    console.log(&quot;Crafting&quot;, tool);
    await client.craft(0, 0, 0, ingredients.map(itemType =&gt; {
      if (itemType == null) return null;

      let item = items[itemType].stacks.filter(item =&gt; {
        return item.type == itemType &amp;&amp; item.amount &gt; 0;
      })[0];
      if (!item) throw new Error(`Out of ${itemType}`);
      item.amount -= 1;

      let [x, y, z] = items[itemType].location;
      return { index: item.index, x, y, z };
    }));
  }
})();
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/09_crafting_results.png" alt="Four crafted tools in a chest"></p>
<p>Excellent! This script will only make one of each tool, but you can modify it to
watch the chest and keep it restocked. You could also experiment with automating
the entire pipeline, running a tree farm and cobblestone generator to supply the
raw materials.</p>
<h2>Advanced building: Cut and paste</h2>
<p>Are you bored of your current environment? Let&#39;s move your entire base somewhere
else! To make this scheme even more interesting, we&#39;ll use minecarts to
automatically move lots of material long distances.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s our setup:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/10_two_structures.png" alt="Two structures connected via minecart"></p>
<p>In order to move our house, we&#39;re going to check what each block is, remove the
block, wait for the minecart to transport it, and finally place it in the other
structure. We&#39;ll also need to make two seperate clients, one for each structure.</p>
<p>To iterate the whole structure, we can use the <code>getSize()</code> API to retrieve its
interior dimensions. Then, for each block, move it to the other structure. This
means we&#39;ll have to break it, wait for the minecart to transport it, and then
place it again on the other side.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ReplCraft = require(&#39;./lib/replcraft.js&#39;);

const sleep = ms =&gt; new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, ms));
let sourceClient = new ReplCraft();
let destClient = new ReplCraft();

(async () =&gt; {
  await sourceClient.login(process.env.tokenSource);
  await destClient.login(process.env.tokenDest);

  let [size_x, size_y, size_z] = await destClient.getSize();

  for (let y = 0; y &lt; size_y; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x &lt; size_x; x++) {
      for (let z = 0; z &lt; size_z; z++) {
        let block = await sourceClient.getBlock(x, y, z);
        await sourceClient.setBlock(x, y, z, &#39;minecraft:air&#39;);
        // Wait for the minecart to make a roundtrip.
        // If you&#39;re particularly inventive, you can figure out how to
        // use redstone signals or container checking to determine when
        // the items have arrived, or use more minecarts to deliver them faster.
        await sleep(5000);
        try {
         await destClient.setBlock(x, y, z, block);
        } catch(ex) {
         console.log(`Failed to move block at ${x} ${y} ${z}: ${ex}`);
        }
      }
    }
  }
})()
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s try it!</p>
<p><video controls autoplay muted loop src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/11_structure_timelapse.webm" alt="A timelapse of one structure's contents being moved into the other"></video></p>
<p>It works! Unfortunantly, it&#39;s not perfect and we&#39;ve lost some glass blocks:</p>
<pre><code>Error: invalid operation: No GLASS available in any attached chests. @ (0, 1, 2)
Error: invalid operation: No GLASS available in any attached chests. @ (2, 1, 0)
Error: invalid operation: No GLASS available in any attached chests. @ (2, 1, 4)
</code></pre>
<p>When breaking blocks, normal Minecraft rules apply. Stone becomes cobblestone,
and glass shatters. You&#39;ll have to find an alternate source of glass, or accept
the lost blocks. The roof blocks have also slightly deformed because stairs
change their connections when their neighbors are broken. We could fix this
by scanning the whole structure in advance.</p>
<h2>Advanced building: Drawing images</h2>
<p>Lets try something a little more artistic. Start off with a <code>16</code>x<code>1</code>x<code>16</code>
 structure, and add at least four stacks of each color of wool to chests
 connected to the structure.
<img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/12_empty_wool_canvas.png" alt="A pancake-shaped structure that looks a bit like a painting frame"></p>
<p>Now we&#39;ll need to figure out what color the various wool blocks are.
<a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/47214">This answer</a> provides a list we can use. Let&#39;s convert that into a
more useful format. We can use this <a href="https://regex101.com/r/9ZjR4H/1">regular expression and replacement rule</a>
to convert the list into psuedo-json:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/automating-minecraft-on-replit/13_regex101.png" alt="A regex in an editor. See above link for contents."></p>
<p>Then we can convert our psuedo-json into actual json and then from an array into an
object by writing a bit of javascript around it. Note that we&#39;ve split our hex
color into three hex numbers, and then added <code>0x</code> in front of them so that
javascript will recognize them as numeric hex literals.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(JSON.stringify(Object.fromEntries([
  [&quot;White&quot;, 0xe4, 0xe4, 0xe4],
  [&quot;Light Gray&quot;, 0xa0, 0xa7, 0xa7],
  [&quot;Dark Gray&quot;, 0x41, 0x41, 0x41],
  [&quot;Black&quot;, 0x18, 0x14, 0x14],
  [&quot;Red&quot;, 0x9e, 0x2b, 0x27],
  [&quot;Orange&quot;, 0xea, 0x7e, 0x35],
  [&quot;Yellow&quot;, 0xc2, 0xb5, 0x1c],
  [&quot;Lime Green&quot;, 0x39, 0xba, 0x2e],
  [&quot;Green&quot;, 0x36, 0x4b, 0x18],
  [&quot;Light Blue&quot;, 0x63, 0x87, 0xd2],
  [&quot;Cyan&quot;, 0x26, 0x71, 0x91],
  [&quot;Blue&quot;, 0x25, 0x31, 0x93],
  [&quot;Purple&quot;, 0x7e, 0x34, 0xbf],
  [&quot;Magenta&quot;, 0xbe, 0x49, 0xc9],
  [&quot;Pink&quot;, 0xd9, 0x81, 0x99],
  [&quot;Brown&quot;, 0x56, 0x33, 0x1c],
].map(([color, r, g, b]) =&gt; {
  return [
    &#39;minecraft:&#39; + color.toLowerCase().replace(/\s/, &#39;_&#39;) + &#39;_wool&#39;,
    [r, g, b]
  ];
}))));
</code></pre>
<p>We can then take the output from that command, and do a few more edits by hand
to tidy it up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let wools = {
  &quot;minecraft:white_wool&quot;: [228,228,228],
  &quot;minecraft:light_gray_wool&quot;: [160,167,167],
  &quot;minecraft:gray_wool&quot;: [65,65,65], // dark_gray is actually just gray
  &quot;minecraft:black_wool&quot;: [24,20,20],
  &quot;minecraft:red_wool&quot;: [158,43,39],
  &quot;minecraft:orange_wool&quot;: [234,126,53],
  &quot;minecraft:yellow_wool&quot;: [194,181,28],
  &quot;minecraft:lime_wool&quot;: [57,186,46], // lime_green is actually just lime
  &quot;minecraft:green_wool&quot;: [54,75,24],
  &quot;minecraft:light_blue_wool&quot;: [99,135,210],
  &quot;minecraft:cyan_wool&quot;: [38,113,145],
  &quot;minecraft:blue_wool&quot;: [37,49,147],
  &quot;minecraft:purple_wool&quot;: [126,52,191],
  &quot;minecraft:magenta_wool&quot;: [190,73,201],
  &quot;minecraft:pink_wool&quot;: [217,129,153],
  &quot;minecraft:brown_wool&quot;: [86,51,28]
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Reading the image</h3>
<p>We&#39;re going to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp">Jimp</a> library to read an image and rescale it if
necessary.</p>
<p>First, we need to load an image. Upload an image to your repl and then load
it with Jimp:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let image = await Jimp.read(&#39;image.png&#39;);
image.resize(16, 16);
</code></pre>
<p>After that, we&#39;ll need to figure out what color of wool to use. To do that,
we can compare our wool colors with the image colors, and pick the closest one.
An easy way to do this is to treat both colors as coordinates and calculate the
distance between them:
<code>distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2 + (z2 - z1)**2)</code>.</p>
<p>To find the closest points, calculate the distances for each possible color and
take the shortest one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let pixel = Jimp.intToRGBA(image.getPixelColor(x, y));
let { wool } = Object.entries(wools)
  .map(([wool, [r, g, b]]) =&gt; { // Calculate the distances
    let distance = Math.sqrt((pixel.r - r)**2 + (pixel.g - g)**2 + (pixel.b - b)**2);
    return { wool, distance };
  })
  .reduce((a, b) =&gt; { // Find the shortest distance
    return a.distance &lt; b.distance ? a : b;
  });
</code></pre>
<h3>Draw it!</h3>
<p>Lets put all our code together and iterate over each block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ReplCraft = require(&#39;./lib/replcraft.js&#39;);
const Jimp = require(&#39;jimp&#39;);

let client = new ReplCraft();
let wools = {

  &quot;minecraft:black_wool&quot;: [24,20,20],
  &quot;minecraft:red_wool&quot;: [158,43,39],
  &quot;minecraft:orange_wool&quot;: [234,126,53],

};

(async () =&gt; {
  let image = await Jimp.read(&#39;image.png&#39;);
  image.resize(16, 16);

  await client.login(process.env.token);
  let [size_x, _, size_z] = await client.getSize();

  let promises = [];
  for (let x = 0; x &lt; size_x; x++) {
    for (let z = 0; z &lt; size_z; z++) {
      let pixel = Jimp.intToRGBA(image.getPixelColor(x, z));
      let { wool } = Object.entries(wools)
        .map(([wool, [r, g, b]]) =&gt; {
          let distance = Math.sqrt((pixel.r - r)**2 + (pixel.g - g)**2 + (pixel.b - b)**2);

<p>Great success!</p>
<h2>Side note: Fuel</h2>
<p>ReplCraft has a concept of <em>fuel</em>, which you use to power API requests. If you run
out of fuel, your client library will start throwing errors. Fuel is optional and
can be provided by multiple configurable sources, but this tutorial assumes it&#39;s
disabled.</p>
<p>Three <em>fuel strategies</em> exist and can be configured by server owners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item strategies, requiring you to burn items in a structure&#39;s inventory to power
requests. For example, 1 gold nugget might be configured to provide 100 fuel.</li>
<li>Ratelimit strategies, which provide a set amount of fuel per time period.
These just exist to prevent you from spamming the server with API calls.</li>
<li>Economy strategies, which use in-game currency to pay for API calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see errors referencing these strategies, you&#39;ll need to offer up the appropriate fuel. You can make your script wait for fuel to become available instead of throwing errors by setting <code>client.retryOnFuelError(true)</code>. You can also monitor for fuel exhaustion via <code>client.on(&quot;outOfFuel&quot;, ex =&gt; { /* ... */ })</code>.</p>
<h1>Going further</h1>
<p>You now know how to make lots of stuff with Replcraft, but that&#39;s only the beginning.</p>
<p>ReplCraft can be used to automate lots of things. Create automated farms, expose
redstone over HTTP, create a clever escape room, automatically craft items,
build an interactive game inside Minecraft, manipulate ChestShop prices, etc.
However, it&#39;s limited to anything you can build a structure around, and it
requires you to manage the supply of blocks!</p>
<p>Bot libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer">Mineflayer</a> allow you to do anything a
regular player can (but may be against the rules on many servers), and learning
how to make mods with the <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-plugin-development/">Spigot</a>, <a href="https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/1.18.x/">Forge</a> or <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/start">Fabric</a>
APIs can give you much more control over the game itself.</p>
