<p>The future of programming is collaborative. To this end, we&#39;ve just added a new feature that unlocks a lot of potential for educators: the ability to annotate code.</p>
<p>Annotations make it easy for students and teachers to communicate. You can point to particular sections of code, clear doubts about syntax, and question decisions during code reviews.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s simple to use: just select a piece of code, click the floating annotate button, type in a message, and send. Once you create an annotation, it functions like chat: you instantly see your collaborators reply and can talk about code in real-time, just like how you write it.</p>
<h3>Remote learning</h3>
<p>This year, as students learn to code online, they are missing out on &#39;shoulder-to-shoulder debugging&#39;, where they work with their peers or teachers on the same screen to fix the inevitable bugs that beginners face.</p>
<p>Repl.it&#39;s multiplayer experience has made it easy to code collaboratively. Some educators remark that it is &#39;better than IRL&#39;, since they no longer have to move around a classroom and context-switch between varying environments on student laptops.</p>
<h3>Feedback loops</h3>
<p>Educators know that short feedback loops are important. Annotations move communication into code in a scalable way. You can have a lengthy threaded conversation about code in real-time, without switching between your editor and a chat platform (one where you don&#39;t have your code in context).</p>
<p>With Annotations, we are building on our mission to help more people code and build together. We hope you&#39;ll give it a try and let us know what you think! It&#39;s still in beta, so you may encounter bugs. If you have suggestions, please leave us feedback <a href="https://replit.canny.io/feedback?sort=new">via our forum</a> or social media.</p>
<p><em>Annotations is now available for <a href="https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education">Teams for Education users</a>. Coming soon for everyone else</em></p>
