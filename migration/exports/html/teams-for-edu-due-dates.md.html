<p>*<em>Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access <a href="https://replit.com/teams-for-education">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>On Tuesday, we announced that <a href="https://blog.replit.com/teams_release">Teams for Education left beta</a>! We mentioned that we&#39;re continuing to roll out more features to help computer science educators empower the next generation of creators and builders. As promised, project due dates are here!</p>
<p>Now, when creating a project, you&#39;ll have the option of setting a due date.</p>

<p>Students are notified when they are submitting late assignments and teachers can easily identify late submissions from the education pane and the submissions dashboard.</p>
