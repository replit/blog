<p>Replit is your computer â€” for whatever you need to do. We announced last year that Hackers would be able to have their <a href="https://blog.replit.com/replspace-filesystems">hosted apps be able to persist file changes</a> since that made it possible to build a lot more apps. But we were not <em>quite</em> satisfied that only Hackers were going to get this new feature.</p>
<p>Today we are announcing that we are opening this up for everyone!</p>
<h2>Why the change?</h2>
<p>Back in November, we knew that this new feature was going to have a small, but measurable, impact to our infrastructure. This meant that opening this up for everyone from the get-go was not ideal. We wanted to get this out to users as soon as possible, so we decided to be iterative. We crafted a plan to open this up for Hackers first to observe what a realistic load would look like, while pondering some potential optimizations that we could use to improve it. In addition, we added more monitoring <em>just in case</em> anything came up.</p>
<p>After enabling this and blogging about it, we saw a very small difference between our predictions and reality. The plan had worked! And our hunch about something unexpected appearing was right on the money: the extra monitoring enabled us to find (and fix) an extremely low-probability bug that could only be observed when operating at Replit scale.</p>
<p>With the new data, we could make data-driven decisions. We went through the planned optimizations and the additional load is now in a much better place, so we&#39;re comfortable opening this up for everyone.</p>
<p>We&#39;re continuing to evolve Replit&#39;s platform to make it the most ubiquitous environment that allows people to code anywhere and everywhere at any time. If this is something that drives you, please <a href="https://replit.com/site/careers">consider joining the team</a>!</p>
