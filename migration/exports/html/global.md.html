<p>We had the idea for Replit in Jordan, launched as a startup in New York, and incorporated as a company in San Mateo. The US gave us the infrastructure, the capital, and network to launch our business, and for that we&#39;re forever grateful. However, to us, the internet is a <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">new country</a> and we want to make our citizenship official and our commitment real. We&#39;re joining our global community of hackers, students, teachers, and entrepreneurs and becoming a global company and service. Starting today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first two non-US compute regions are up --  Mumbai, India and London, England -- making us a global service</li>
<li>We&#39;re hiring worldwide making us a globally distributed company</li>
</ul>
<h2>Global routing</h2>
<p>Previously, Replit has been operating out of a single datacenter in
the United States. When you start a repl, or join multiplayer, all
of your traffic had to make it to our one datacenter.</p>
<p>While that&#39;s not a significant issue if you live nearby, for our
friends all over the world it means every time you type a letter,
you had to cross an ocean at least twice! That means you could see
latencies as high as 300ms for each keystroke in the terminal! Now, when you create
a repl, it lives in the datacenter closest to you. Instead of
everyone having to cross the ocean multiple times, you can feel even
closer than your own computer! And if you have friends far away, things
will feel better too. Instead of connecting to a datacenter that is
far away, you&#39;ll connect to the datacenter closest to you, and
we&#39;ll deliver your bits as quickly as possible,
so you don&#39;t have to travel the world all on your own.</p>
<p>If you lived in India prior to our new data center, you saw significant delay in actions like running your code:</p>

<p>This is what you&#39;ll see today:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/global/after.gif" alt="after latency"></p>
<p>With these changes coding with friends and coworkers from all
over the world will feel closer than ever, and we&#39;re only just
getting started! We&#39;ve made it super easy for us to ship to even
more countries, datacenters, and devices around the world. Before you
know it you might even be able to have a Replit data center in your
own home!</p>

<h1>Hiring globally</h1>
<p>Because we&#39;re still a highly collaborative small team and we haven&#39;t perfected the art of asynchronous we require employees to overlap with PST working hours for four hours a day. Otherwise you can be wherever you want in the world. </p>
