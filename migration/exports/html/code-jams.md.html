<p>A few months ago, we created a new Discord channel - a real time chat app - for Repl.it.  We&#39;ve since expanded our user count to be well over 500.  Our Discord server is community-driven - we have a team of three users who help us moderate the server and facilitate a culture of friendly collaboration and sharing knowledge.  However, our favorite outcome of this community are the code jams.</p>
<p>Code jams are basically online hackathons that span from 24 to 48 hours long.  Each code jam has a theme which is revealed to its participants at the beginning of the event.  Each user creates a submission based on the given theme; their submissions must be created and developed during the code jam (no using previous work).</p>
<p>From these code jams, we&#39;ve seen some incredible work created in a small amount of time.  But more importantly, we&#39;ve been able to see the best of our community through its interactions.  Participants had their own #code-jam channel in which they could discuss the jam, their work, and any questions that they had.  Make no mistake - it was a competition - and they wanted to win.  But that didn&#39;t stop them from helping out their fellow competitors debug their programs, provide feedback, and test our their work.</p>
<p>Our latest code jam wrapped up last weekend, where users made single player games.  The winner was clear - <a href="https://repl.it/@theangryepicbanana">@theangryepicbanana</a> made a game called <a href="https://CodeJam2--theangryepicbanana.repl.co">Switch</a> using p5.js.  The mods who graded this game thought it was original, fun to play, and well polished.</p>
<p>A demonstration of the game is below - or play it yourself <a href="https://CodeJam2--theangryepicbanana.repl.co">here</a>!</p>
