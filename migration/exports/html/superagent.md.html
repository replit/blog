<p>Demand for AI-driven solutions is surging, and using an AI-assistant is the fastest way to integrate AI into any product. Superagent’s assistants leverage large language models to understand human language, reason, and perform various tasks.</p>
<p>In the spirit of “idea to software, fast”, <a href="https://www.superagent.sh/">superagent.sh</a> used Replit to create an open-source, Agentic AI framework that enables any developer to integrate production ready AI Assistants into any application in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Within 48 hours of Replit’s <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ai-agents-code-execution">code-exec library release</a>, superagent.sh added it to their core framework, deployed it (using <a href="https://blog.replit.com/autoscale">Replit Autoscale</a>), and created a Repl that enables anyone in the open source community to fork it, customize it, and deploy it themselves.</p>
