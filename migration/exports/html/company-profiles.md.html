<p>Today, we launch partnerships with 19 companies, offering 35+ templates for Replit users to build with. The goal? Helping our community build the next-generation of projects. Let me explain.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/BD/220727_LaunchPartner.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Context: The growing strength of the Replit community</h2>
<p>The Replit community is growing exponentially. As of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>+15M Replit users</li>
<li>+20M websites &amp; apps created and hosted</li>
<li>+10B monthly visits across websites &amp; apps</li>
<li>+2B Repls run</li>
</ul>
<p>In parallel, Replit as a platform has grown stronger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports all programming languages.</li>
<li>80,000+ packages.</li>
<li>Mobile app coming soon.</li>
<li>State-of-the-art AI features.</li>
<li>Ready-to-build templates.</li>
<li>Replit Ventures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every month, Replit raises the ceiling on what devs can do.</p>
<p>As a result, Replit users are building increasingly sophisticated projects. From learning their first line of code to building an app to <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1506429498895470592?s=20&t=o_psEi7bsBSElw5QRDYkkg">monetizing their creation</a>. Users are even landing jobs as professional developers from Replit.</p>
<h2>The next generation of developers</h2>
<p>At Replit, we&#39;ve always been about the future of software and bringing it to everyone, not just the lucky few in Silicon Valley. We feel strongly the next-generation of developers looks very different than the last. Globally distributed. Digital and cloud-native. Able to code and deploy from a $10 android phone.</p>
<p>Our user base and product reflect this future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 80% of Replit users are based outside of the US</li>
<li>Over 10% of Replit users code on mobile devices - not code for mobile, actually coding from a mobile device.</li>
<li>Thriving community where people share code, collaborate, and have fun</li>
<li>Idea to code to deployed apps in minutes not hours</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have a professional product, most of our users code for fun.</p>
<p>To engage these developers, the old way - things like on-site hackathons in Sunnyvale where companies offer pizza  - won&#39;t work. Companies looking to find awesome new developers need to engage users where they are passionate. Replit is how to do that. Here&#39;s more on how.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/BD/220727_NewGame.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Live hosted examples</h3>
<p>Ditch the static repository files. Host live templates for developers and potential customers to see the product in action immediately.</p>
<h3>Show them how to do it</h3>
<p>Rather than explain your product, pull up a ready-to-go template anytime, anywhere. At a coffee shop? Run it on a mobile phone with Replit. At a conference? Send the url to the audience, so they can follow from their device. On a Zoom meeting? Send the Repl link in the chat.</p>
<h3>Multiplayer coding</h3>
<p>Stop sending back-and-forth emails. Code together.</p>
<p>&quot;Try adding ____ on line 1,947&quot;
&quot;There is a syntax error when you try to ____&quot;
&quot;Did you install ___ package? ___ library?&quot;</p>
<p>No more. Jump into the users project with a join link and multiplayer code. For a live event, have users &amp; customers jump into the code base with you. For async support, jump in &amp; leave comments like a Google Doc. Spread the love. Leverage your valuable dev rel time how you do best.</p>
<h3>User-led features</h3>
<p>Engage directly with your user base. Source feedback on your product. See what they build!</p>
<h2>Building a Company Profile on Replit</h2>
<p>Over the past few months, we have introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>The following feed</li>
<li>Community published templates</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, companies have a central place where they can build a following of developers, host high-quality templates, and bolster their developer brand.</p>
<p>And today, we are introducing the &quot;verified&quot; badge for companies. We will be validating and verifying companies  and engagement for the Replit community.</p>
