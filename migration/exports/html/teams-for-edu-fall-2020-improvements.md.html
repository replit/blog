<p>*<em>Edit: As of March 2022, Teams for Education is free for all educators. You can gain access <a href="https://replit.com/teams-for-education">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>This Fall we will be shipping a series of small and large improvements to the Teams for Education product. We are laser-focused on making Repl.it the best solution for learning how to code; especially during extended periods of distance learning.</p>
<h2>Easy Grading and Feeback Using Project Switcher</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/edu_pane.gif" alt="Teams for Education Editor Pane"></p>
<p>Grade projects faster with our new Project Switcher! Instead of tediously clicking &quot;View Submission&quot; for every student, you may now view, leave feedback, and annotate student project submissions without leaving your workspace. </p>
<p>You can also use the Project Switcher to seamlessly navigate between Projects. We hope this helps relieve some anxiety while rushing to submit grades before the end of the semester!</p>
<h2>Bulk Invite Students via CSV File</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/csv_invites.gif" alt="CSV file upload">
Invite all of your students to your Team at once by uploading a single CSV file. No need for students to have a Repl.it account beforehand - just provide their email addresses.</p>
<h2>Student Project Perma-Links</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/teams_edu/stu_perma_links.gif" alt="student project perma-links">
Assign projects quickly using permanent student links to Team Projects. Only students who are part of your Team will be able to use your project perma-link. This improvement will make it more efficient to share links within your existing LMS.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>That&#39;s not all! We have several exciting things arriving before the end of 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code-free input/output test authoring and autograding</li>
<li>A better onboarding experience for teachers </li>
<li>Webinars and training on Teams for Education</li>
<li>Snazzy new Teams profiles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Giving Feedback Goes a Long Way</h2>
<p>Teachers continue to express their enthusiasm for multiplayer Repls, annotations, and group projects. We will continue to build on these new platform features to provide a seamless collaborative experience for project based learning. </p>
