<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/heroku2gcp"><strong>(1/11) Migrating from Heroku to GCP</strong></a> - It&#39;s not easy running 1M concurrent Repls across the globe. Now imagine migrating that entire infrastructure! To bring the next billion software creators online, this was something we needed to do to serve even more developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/python-new-template"><strong>(2/4) New Python Repl updates</strong></a> - Python is the most popular programming language on Replit. We changed the way we cache packages, making it way faster to boot any Python-based Repl.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/filesystem-persistence-for-all"><strong>(2/11) File persistence</strong></a> - In 2021, we offered file persistence for Hacker users only; this year, we expanded this to ALL hosted apps on Replit.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/powered-by-nix"><strong>(2/23) Powered by Nix</strong></a> - After a year of hard work, we fully integrated Nix into our platform. This was a critical migration, allowing Replit to support any and every programming language, and unlocking the ability for the community to create and manage templates for popular languages and configurations.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/codemirror"><strong>(3/10) CodeMirror Migration</strong></a> - To make Replit more extensible, we migrated our code editor from Monaco to CodeMirror. This contrarian bet has already paid dividends to the open-source community as we&#39;ve built and open-sourced several CodeMirror extensions like Vim keybindings and Solidity language support. And its opened the door for community-built extensions in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/geo-part-1-controlplane"><strong>(7/8) Controlplane</strong></a> - The Replit developer base is global. As a result, we are geo-distributing our infrastructure, so performance can improve for international developers. The first step to this was Control Plane. We landed (get it?) it mid-year, setting us up to build out a globally distributed network.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.replit.com/geo-part-2-loadbalancing"><strong>(9/26) Load Balancer</strong></a> - In July, we landed (get it again?) Control Plane. That was Part 1 of geo-distribution. The Google Cloud load balancer, however, did not quite fit our needs... so we built our own! This dramatically improved machine utilization and Replit performance.</p>
