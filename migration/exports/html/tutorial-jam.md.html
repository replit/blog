<p>Giving learners a space to navigate the world of coding in small, digestable bites, while also being a part of the Replit Community is one way we are bringing the next billion software creators online! But, there is another, much bigger, way to do this. Let Community lead the way with a Tutorial Jam....</p>
<h2>Why Tutorials?</h2>
<p>Replit has always been a place for creators, educators, and learners. Recently, learners of all levels have been requesting more educational content.

<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOGs2oEyP4I">Curriculum Jam winners</a> are a pair of teenagers running their own start up, <a href="https://missionencodeable.com/about">Mission Encodable</a>, determined to bring better content and learning tools to their school. Users from all coding backgrounds are learning along with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=replit100daysofcode&src=typed_query">Replit&#39;s 100 Days of Code</a>. We have the <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum">Curriculum Hub</a> for educators, but we want <em>more</em> for <em>more</em> users. Allowing everyone to add tutorials gives greater equity of access and ability to meet the needs of the versatile Replit Community.</p>
<h2>How Do I Create Tutorials?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l650luzyQGs">Tutorial Pane</a> made its debut with <a href="https://replit.com/learn">100 Days of Code</a>. The best part about this simple feature is it&#39;s available to everyone in a regular repl and is super easy to set up with just a few steps:</p>
<p>‚èÆ Inside any repl, create a fdolder called <code>.tutorial</code>.</p>
<p>‚èÆ Within this folder, create as many markdown files as you like. They will automatically sort alphabetically (so add numbers to sort the order). </p>
<p>‚èÆ The level one heading on each markdown file will be the title that appears in the table of contents and the progress indicator. </p>
<p>‚èÆ Add a file called <code>video.json</code> within the <code>.tutorial</code> folder. </p>
<p>‚èÆ Embed a video with <code>{ &quot;embedUrl&quot;: &quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uniquevideocode&quot;}</code> The embed link needs to be a YouTube video. </p>
<p>‚èÆ Reload the repl. </p>
<p>Need extra help? Follow along with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l650luzyQGs">video</a> and see the tool in action in <a href="https://building-templates.davidatreplit.repl.co/">this documentation</a>!</p>
<h2>What Can I Create?</h2>
<p><em>Everyone</em> is an educator. Yes, you heard that correctly! Anyone who has something to share that will help other Replers learn <em>is</em> an educator. What can you share? Show off your skills by particpating in our upcoming <a href="https://tutorial-jam.replit-community.repl.co/">Tutorial Jam</a>. Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEPDZzArTQ0">live kick-off party</a> is October 29. The winners of this Jam will be among the first to have their content showcased on Replit.</p>
