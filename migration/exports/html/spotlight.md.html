<p>Replit has never been <em>just</em> about code.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also about the stories we tell, the apps and games we build, and how we collaborate. It&#39;s a part of Replit&#39;s DNA to make our community baked into the experience of learning and making.</p>
<p>Today, we&#39;re announcing <code>Spotlight pages</code>: a new way to showcase your repls to the world. Whenever you visit someone else&#39;s repl, you&#39;ll see its Spotlight page where you can play with the repl&#39;s output, browse its code, and comment all in one place. And if you want to start a multiplayer session with someone new, you can directly request to edit their repl.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://repl.it/@slmjkdbtl/flappy?view=1">Here&#39;s a demo</a> of adding a new feature to a game using the Kaboom framework on Replit.</em></p>
<p>We were motivated to create this new page for two main reasons: to make repls the <strong>host</strong> of social activity, and to separate repl <strong>creation</strong> from <strong>presentation</strong>.</p>
<p>Previously, you had to create a post on Repl Talk in order to comment on repls. The issue, though, was that if you ever visited someone else&#39;s repl, you&#39;d be automatically taken to the Workspace which had <em>no reference</em> to the posts about it! Even worse, the primary content you&#39;d see on a post was <em>text</em>, not the repl itself.</p>
<p>Now, instead of manually creating a post that you attach a repl to, <strong>your repl is social by default</strong> and it&#39;s the main star of the show ‚≠êÔ∏è.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://repl.it/@rafrafraf/IOS">Here&#39;s a demo</a> of requesting to edit a repl that recreates the iOS home screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</em></p>
<p>We wanted to separate repl creation from presentation for a very simple reason: they&#39;re super different activites!</p>
<p>Think about it like this: editing a video is much different than posting on YouTube. Composing a song is different than publishing on Spotify. Painting a portrait in a studio is much different than hosting an exhibit in a museum.</p>
<p>And on Replit, writing code in the Workspace is different than viewing your Spotlight page. They&#39;re distinct activites that require distinct experiences, especially as Replit&#39;s community grows.</p>
<p>To open to a repl&#39;s Spotlight page from the Workspace, open up the popover in the header and click <code>Open Spotlight page</code>.</p>

<p>...and of course, you can fork any repl to tinker with whatever you want.</p>

<p>Spotlight pages mark a signifcant step forward in the evolution of Replit as a platform: an environment for being creative <em>and</em> sharing that creativity. Although Spotlight pages are simple and relatively barebones right now, they&#39;re just one piece of the rest of improvements we&#39;re making.</p>
<p>After this, we&#39;re working on a new feature called <code>Explore</code> that will let you publish repls and browse them easily, all of which will automatically link to Spotlight pages.</p>
<p>With updates coming soon to your <code>Profile</code>, you&#39;ll be proud to showcase live, running, breathing apps-- not just dead code. Every profile will be a place to share and talk, which means that anyone can essentially create and manage their own community.</p>
<p>And as <code>Teams</code> and <code>Multiplayer</code> continue to develop, more people than ever will be able to directly work together and create their own studios, hackathons, learning groups, businesses, and more.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll continue to add features and improve this feature as we hear more feedback from y&#39;all. So if you have thoughts, leave a comment on its <a href="https://repl.it/@tangert/Spotlight-pages?view=1">Spotlight page</a> üòâ</p>
<p>And if making apps easier to create and share interests you, <a href="https://repl.it/site/careers">we&#39;re hiring</a>.</p>
