<p>Repl.it is already the best place to build your apps. But there was a missing piece: where do you store your data?</p>
<p>We’re introducing Repl.it Database: a fast, free, and easy key-value store that’s built into every repl.[](preview end)</p>
<p>All you have to do is import one of our packages for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>, and you can instantly start setting keys in your database.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>Because Database is built-in, there is no setup, provisioning, or configuration. It&#39;s the fastest and easiest way to store data on Repl.it.</p>
<p>To get off the ground, fork our <a href="https://repl.it/@util/Database-Flask-comments-example">example Python and Flask emoji app</a> so that you can quickly get to hacking!</p>

<h2>Key-value</h2>
<p>Key-value databases are conceptually simple: they’re a flat map of keys to their values. There are no schemas, tables, or columns. There are only a few operations that you need to perform: set a key to a value, get a key’s value, delete a key, and search for keys.</p>
<p>Those simple operations are enough to support all kinds of applications, from blogs with posts and comments, to game backends with leaderboards, to <a href="https://repl.email">email platforms</a>.</p>
<h2>Multi-language</h2>
<p>We provide Database clients for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>. But you can talk to Database from any language over HTTP. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In Python, our client serializes and deserializes dictionaries and lists so that you can use them to store more complex data:</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>Repl.it is the best place to start building your app. And Database is the easiest way to just jump in, get coding, and store your data without having to set anything up.</p>
<p>For more details on Database, click on the Database icon in your repl’s sidebar or <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">check out the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>With Database, you can build a fully-featured app entirely on Repl.it. We can’t wait to see what you create!</p>
