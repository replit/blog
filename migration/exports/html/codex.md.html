<p><em>Update: To stay up to date on Replit and AI, check out our <a href="https://blog.replit.com/ai">Ghostwriter Beta &amp; AI mode</a> announcement. In it we discuss how we infused state-of-the-art intelligence into nearly all IDE features as well as the future of AI on Replit.</em></p>

<p>At Replit, one of our fundamental goals is to make programming easier.</p>
<p>When we got a first glimpse at OpenAI&#39;s new <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/">Codex model</a>, our instinct was to think of how it could help people understand programs better—especially beginners.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve tested ideas before that used OpenAI&#39;s more general model, GPT-3, to ask questions about code. Amjad wrote about some of these explorations <a href="https://blog.replit.com/codingai">on our blog</a> last year.</p>
<p>So we&#39;re very excited to partner with OpenAI to start beta testing Codex-powered features across Replit.</p>
<h3>Code explanation</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re on our <a href="https://replit.com/site/pricing">hacker plan,</a> or you use <a href="https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education">Teams for Education</a> for higher ed, you&#39;ll soon see Codex-powered features available to you.</p>
<p>The first feature you&#39;ll see is called <strong>Explain Code.</strong> It lets you select any code in JavaScript and Python files and ask Codex to explain it for you. Ever forked a project, or been looking through a library, and been unsure what the code you&#39;re looking at <em>actually does</em>? This is for you.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/codex/codex.gif" alt="Explain Code feature"></p>
<ol>
<li>Highlight some code (full blocks work best, like a whole function or declaration) </li>
<li>Click &quot;Explain Code&quot;</li>
<li>See if the explanation is good! Because these features rely on an ML model, the results won&#39;t always be perfect. So we also ask if the explanations the model generates are good, which helps us understand where the model performs best.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Coming soon</h3>
<p>There are a few other features we&#39;re testing, that we might release into beta soon. For example, asking Codex to explain why parts of code aren&#39;t working the way you might expect. Or using Codex to explain confusing compiler errors. Or <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/#talkingtoyourcomputer">formatting code by talking to it.</a></p>
<h3>Where we&#39;re going</h3>
<p>There are <em>lots</em> of ways we could use Codex features across Replit — this is just the start. We hope that releasing these beta features helps us understand where and how AI can be useful for people on their programming journey.</p>
