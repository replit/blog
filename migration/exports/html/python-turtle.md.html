<p>Ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language">LOGO programming
language</a> educators
have been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle Graphics</a>
to demonstrate the power of programming to their students while making it fun and
interesting.[](preview end)</p>
<p>In fact, my first real programming experience was when I was 6 years old
learning LOGO at school. I learned how to program the turtle to draw a square
and a triangle which I then put together to create a house. However, I was frustrated
that I had to keep repeating the code to create a village made from
multiple houses -- and that&#39;s how discovered loops! It&#39;s a natural way for
children to learn programming. Here is an <a href="https://repl.it/DoYJ/1">example turtle graphic house</a> in
repl.it :)</p>

<p>So far, we&#39;ve been focused on what we think was largely missing from the web:
running programs that typically require installing a compiler or an interpreter
on your computer. However, now that we&#39;ve
built <a href="https://repl.it/classroom">tools</a> for teachers to bring programming to
their classroom, many want to use turtle graphics as part of their
cirriculum. And that&#39;s why we&#39;re excited to introduce <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html">Turtle Graphics</a>
support for Python.</p>
<p>To get started just select <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python_turtle"><code>Python (with Turtle)</code></a> from the list of languages,
import the <code>turtle</code> module and start drawing!</p>
<p><em>The Python Turtle implementation is powered by the <a href="http://skulpt.org">Skulpt open source project</a>.</em></p>
