<p>Today we&#39;re excited to announce that Always On repls are available to all hackers! Anyone with <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">Hacker plan</a> can choose up to 5 repls and keep them running all the time. Users with a free plan can access Always On power ups <a href="https://replit.com/cycles">using Cycles</a>! With Always On, you can for example spin up and host an app like a Discord bot in 30 seconds:</p>

<p>As a reminder, Replit gives you most of what you need to rapidly build and ship apps in the cloud -- at lightning speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blazing fast <a href="https://repl.it/site/ide">online IDE</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/packages">Package Management</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://repl.it/site/hosting">hosting</a></li>
<li>Automatic <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">SSL/HTTPS</a></li>
<li>Domain <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">linking</a></li>
<li>A simple and fast <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">Database for persistence</a></li>
<li>A secure way to <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/secret-keys">store secrets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The one missing piece was a reliable way to keep your apps from going to sleep. Always On means we host your code and keep it running even if you close your Replit browser tab.</p>
<p>Prior to Always On, you might have noticed that when your repl is inactive for a little while it automatically goes to sleep. Because Replit wants to give everyone in the world the ability to code and access cloud computing, this has been a super important cost-saving mechanism and vital to the design of our infrastructure (you can read about the technical details <a href="https://blog.repl.it/killing-containers-at-scale">here</a>). As much as we&#39;d like it to, hosting 100 million repls all the time for free just wouldn&#39;t work out. Instead we&#39;ve invested in getting really fast at starting repls when they&#39;re needed and pretending like they were up the whole time. It has served us and our users well, but doesn&#39;t work in every use-case.</p>

<p>Some repls expect to be running all the time (things like cron or Discord bots), and some apps can&#39;t afford to drop some requests as the repl wakes up. As our users built increasingly ambitious apps, the need for a repl to keep running all the time has become apparent. With Always On your repl will function mostly like before, but now it won&#39;t stop running when you close the workspace.</p>
<p>Always On repls can be incredibly useful for a variety of programs and unlocks many long-requested features. The most obvious and commonly requested is for web servers to stay up. If you&#39;re tired of waiting for your webserver to wake up every time you visit, Always On is a great way to fix that. But Always On isn&#39;t just for web repls, regular old repls work too! If you have a cron job you&#39;d like to run on a schedule, Always On makes it super easy. Discord bots, Slack bots, and other chat bots with a persistent outbound connection are another great use for Always On. And if you have a workload that&#39;s taking a long time (like say scraping a site), you can Always On the repl and go one with your life.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#39;s worth noting a few limitations of Always On</p>
<ul>
<li>Your repl will be occasionally restarted as it is migrated between physical servers.</li>
<li>Changes your program makes to the filesystem won&#39;t persist, so we suggest you use <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">Replit Database</a> rather than, for example, writing to text files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.replit.com/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>We also want to make it clear that the use of pinging services will continue to work just as before.</p>
<p>Happy coding! If you create something interesting or novel using this technology then make sure to <a href="https://repl.it/talk/ask/Share-your-Always-On-repls/120784">share it with us</a>.</p>
<h2>One more thing</h2>
<p>Oh one more thing. right now replit doesn&#39;t differentiate between dev and prod apps. We&#39;re going to fix that too, and it will be epic. Stay tuned.</p>
