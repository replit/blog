<p>Arguments over programming language semantics, standard library behavior, or
syntax can now be simply and immediately settled within the chatroom by talking

ever-present on Messenger and can be added to your team chat on Slack.[](preview end)</p>

<em>Evalbot: a bot that speaks code</em></p>
<p>Beyond settling arguments we envision Evalbot to be useful for teaching and
learning programming in chatrooms and for quickly running programs in Messenger
on the go. That, and it&#39;s just a fun hack that we enjoyed working on :)</p>
<p>Evalbot can be interacted with in a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Named code fences are parsed and executed</li>
</ul>
