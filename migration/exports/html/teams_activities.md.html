<p>You can do it, teachers! The end of the school year is in sight (at least for our North American friends ðŸ˜­)</p>
<p>Final exams are over, but you still need <em>something</em> to do with your students for the next few weeks. We&#39;ve got you covered. </p>
<p>Here are our top <del>five</del> six (because we couldn&#39;t choose just five) end of year project ideas that your kids will actually be excited about (and may continue doing on their own once school is out!) Isn&#39;t that every teacher&#39;s dream?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Did you know that Replit created a homegrown JavaScript game framework language, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/kaboom2000">kaboom.js</a>, that allows users to create 2D games. And we recently added <a href="https://blog.replit.com/kaboomdraw">Kaboom Draw</a> too! Assign a project using kaboom.js and let your students get creative!</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to really go deep, you can import <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Build-a-Video-Game-with-Kaboom">this</a> Kaboom curriculum into a team (don&#39;t forget, <a href="https://blog.replit.com/teamsforedu_free">teams are now FREE</a>!). Students can learn about how objects move, gravity, and more all while making a video game.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Give your students a chance to show off their Python skills (and the power of Replit) by creating a <a href="https://replit.com/curriculum/Build-a-Simple-Game-with-Python">simple Python game</a> with only a few lines of code. You can also use the new <a href="https://blog.replit.com/search">search feature</a> to find more inspiration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are looking for something focused on HTML/CSS/JavaScript, your students can create a <a href="https://replit.com/@codewithharry/Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS#index.html">calculator</a>. Their math teachers will thank you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Need something to get their literacy juices flowing? This <a href="https://replit.com/@CoderGautamYT/wordle">wordle clone</a> by @CoderGautman will get their dictionaries on! Why stop there? Get them to fork and improve on it: on screen keyboards, fancier styling, a list of different words; remix as much as possible!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extra credit project needed? Code an RPG game in less  than 3 minutes using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcoiEpzD3yc">this</a> tutorial (and of course, Kaboom.js)!</p>
</li>
