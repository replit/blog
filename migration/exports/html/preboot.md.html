<p><a href="react">Two days</a> ago we introduced our beta support for React frameworks, ranging from
static-site generators like GatsbyJS, to fullstack frameworks like
Next.js. Today we&#39;re launching a significant performance enhancement that we&#39;re
calling <strong>preboot</strong>.</p>
<p>Whenever you land on a repl, you get a container to develop against. Our containers are generic and work for any
language/framework. When you land on a React framework, you had to hit &quot;run&quot;
to start the server (it basically sends a <code>yarn develop</code> or similar to the container)
. The container manager will then detect an open port, send an
event to the IDE, which will show you a webview (speeded up gif below) -- afterward, you&#39;re on
your way building your app.</p>

<p>However, this kind of experience is suboptimal because it&#39;s slow. We pride
ourselves on setting up the development environment within 2 seconds of selecting
a language/framework so, naturally, we need to do better.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have previously implemented a pooling mechanism on our
infrastructure so that containers are ready and hot when you need them. What was
missing from that is custom &quot;boot&quot; command that gets the container <em>really</em> hot,
listening on a port, and ready to start serving. So now, when you land on a
React framework environment, we grab a container for you that&#39;s already
running -- your repl IDE will simply attach to it.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>

<p>As mentioned in the announcement post, we&#39;re moving fast on getting this
out of beta into something we&#39;re proud of and can, with confidence, offer
to you as, if not your primary development environment, at least your
secondary/prototyping one.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
