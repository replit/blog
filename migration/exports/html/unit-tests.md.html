<p>Unit testing is a powerful way to verify that code works as intended and creates a quick feedback loop for development &amp; learning. However, setting up a reproducible unit-testing environment is a time-consuming and delicate affair. At Replit, our goal is to give people coding superpowers by demolishing barriers and democratizing access to expert tools. Today, we&#39;re launching our zero-setup unit testing environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/unit_tests/unit_tests.gif" alt="unit tests demo"></p>
<p>At launch we&#39;ll support three of our most popular programming languages: Java, Python, and JavaScript pre-setup with the most popular frameworks in each category. We&#39;ll be adding more with time, and you can visit our <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/UnitTesting">docs</a> for more information about how to get started.</p>
<p>We think this feature will be handy for CS educators, online course creators, and developers. But as always, we&#39;re excited to explore unique ways people will leverage this feature. So let us know how you use it!</p>
