<h1>Hello from the Kajam Mentors</h1>
<p>Ten Replit users were chosen to be mentors for <a href="https://kajam.replit.com">Kajam</a>, which is Replit&#39;s annual game jam.  Each mentor&#39;s purpose was to be on call throughout the competition to help others out with brainstorming, code problems, and offer feedback.</p>
<p><a href="https://replit.com/@IroncladDev">IroncladDev</a>, <a href="https://replit.com/@haroon">Dainfloop/haroon</a>, and <a href="https://replit.com/@bddy">bddy</a> collaborated to create a surprise game for the closing ceremony of the jam.  Try it out for yourself <a href="https://replit.com/@haroon/Tarragon?v=1">here.</a> </p>
<p>Oh, also, we can&#39;t forget <a href="https://replit.com/@CodingCactus">CodingCactus</a> and <a href="https://replit.com/@Coder100">Coder100</a> for helping out on some ideas for the game!</p>

<h2>Mentor Experience</h2>
<p>As a whole, the mentors agreed that mentoring experience awesome. Although there were less questions than expected, ultimately the mentors had a great time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The mentoring experience was amazing.  Even though I wasn&#39;t asked as many questions as I expected, it felt like a big accomplishment every time I helped someone fix a problem with code, offer feedback on a game, and brainstorm&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@IroncladDev">IroncladDev</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The experience was amazing, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been involved in the community this much before. We weren&#39;t asked for help that often, when we did help it was explained quite well for the user to understand. Overall, it was awesome to be involved.&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@haroon">DaInfLoop</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mentoring Kajam has been great. I&#39;ve had the chance to help a lot of people on both the Replit and Kaboom servers. I think mentors is a very useful tool especially with your first games :)&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@lajbel">Danie (lajbel)</a></p>

<h2>The Surprise Game</h2>
<p>Some of us were being pretty jumpy.  We then decided to make a game that would be presented in the Kajam closing ceremony since we had a lot of time on our hands.</p>
<p>Instead of one week, we had two until the closing ceremony, so we kind of relaxed and built our game.</p>
<p>The first day was mainly brainstorming and coming up with some awesome, mediocre, and hillarious ideas.  <a href="https://replit.com/@CodingCactus">CodingCactus</a> came up with the idea of a dragon that would breathe fire when it had chilli peppers, <a href="https://replit.com/@bddy">bddy</a> came up with a bird game where you had to pepper-spray birds out of the sky, and a few more were created by other mentors.  The idea of the dragon was taken up, and the bird one was kicked out of the sky.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I drew the graphics and built most of the game mechanics.  I&#39;ll tell you one thing, pixel art animation is <strong>hard</strong>!!  Overall the other pieces of the game went pretty smoothly.  It was amazing collaborating with my fellow mentors!&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@IroncladDev">IroncladDev</a></p>

<p>&quot;It was my first time using p5.js, and learning a new library is hard, especially when p5 isn&#39;t really meant for game design even! However with the tutorials that Ironclad gave before Kajam started, it helped quite a bit. Seeing as it was some people&#39;s first time with Kaboom and many other different libraries that were used, I do sympathise for them.&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@haroon">DaInfLoop</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was also my first time using p5.js, it was hard. I kept practicing it, and tried to help with the game. As I didn&#39;t help much, I gave some ideas.&quot; - <a href="https://replit.com/@bddy">bddy</a></p>
