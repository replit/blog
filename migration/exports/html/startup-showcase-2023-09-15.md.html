<h2>The fastest way to start, ship, and share</h2>
<p>The Replit platform isn&#39;t just a sandbox; it&#39;s a launchpad. There’s a lot to learn from startups building on Replit and how they leverage the platform to monetize and grow.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a solo developer bootstrapping their time on <a href="https://replit.com/bounties?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=startup_showcase-2023-09-15">Bounties</a>, or a startup launching their production application on Replit Deployments, the businesses on Replit demonstrate that Replit is the best place for iteration and feedback cycles to carry a project from idea to product market fit.</p>
<p>To prove this, we&#39;re sharing a few companies building and shipping on Replit today.</p>
<h2>Leap API - Headshot AI</h2>
<p>Add image, music, and other AI generations to your app in minutes with Leap&#39;s API and SDK.
<a href="https://replit.com/@leap-ai/">Leap</a> launched “Headshot AI”, an app that allows you to generate a professional headshot in minutes. No need to schedule a professional headshot session for that perfect LinkedIn Photo. Just upload some of your existing photos to fine-tune the model to your face and get your professional results in minutes.</p>
<p>The “Headshot AI” project from Leap is a fully-featured, open source application on Replit. Once you fork <a href="https://replit.com/@leap-ai/Headshot-AI-Professional-Headshots-with-Leap-AI?v=1?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=startup_showcase-2023-09-15">the project here</a>, use Ghostwriter to Explain the structure for a fully-functioning GenAI web app by forking and remixing. Or you can play with the live <a href="https://headshots-starter.replit.app/">demo app here</a>.</p>

<h2>LlamaIndex</h2>
<p>Try out LlamaIndex by forking <a href="https://replit.com/@LlamaIndex/LlamaIndex-QandA-Question-Answering-System#README.md?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=startup_showcase-2023-09-15">this template</a> and adding your OpenAI key to the Secrets tab in Replit. In less than 2 minutes, you’ll have a working chatbot that can answer questions on a PDF with Lyft’s 2021 financial report.</p>
<p>Try remixing the code by adding in your own PDFs or datasources. Once you’re done, push your chatbot to a live website using <a href="https://replit.com/deployments?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=startup_showcase_2023_09_13">Replit Deployments</a> to share it with real users in minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/">LlamaIndex</a> is a fully-featured framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models. In other words, if you’re ever looking for a quick way to augment an LLM like GPT with custom data including APIs, PDFs, documents, and SQL, then LlamaIndex is the best solution for you.</p>

<h2>Prodia</h2>
<p><a href="https://prodia.com/">Prodia</a> wanted to build a Discord bot to demonstrate the power and simplicity of their text-to-image API. Instead of assigning internal developer resources to the task, the team leveraged the <a href="https://replit.com/bounties?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=startup_showcase-2023-09-15">Replit Bounties network</a> to spin up a fully-featured <a href="https://replit.com/@Prodia/AI-Discord-Bot#README.md">Discord bot</a> that could demonstrate their API’s capabilities.</p>
<p>In an effort to drive user engagement and growth, Prodia asked their Bounty Hunter, <a href="https://replit.com/@techpandapro">TechPandaPro</a>, to build a gamified feature for the Discord bot where users can prompt many images in a 5 minute period and compete for the best output. Once 5 minutes are up, users submit their best image generation and have others in the channel vote for a winner.</p>
<p>Prodia’s product is one of the fastest APIs for generating AI images from text. The Prodia API let’s anyone send prompts programmatically via a REST endpoint and get AI-generated media back in less than 4 seconds.</p>
<p>With Replit templates, Prodia offers pre-configured demo application environments. These templates allow developers to instantly fork the code and see the API in action. This substantially reduces the entry barriers for new developers and allows them to focus on building rather than configuring.</p>

<h2>Dublit</h2>
<p><a href="https://dublit.org/">Dublit</a> launched an open-source Flask app to demonstrate how easy it is to develop a personal cloud that erasure-codes data across a distributed infrastructure.</p>
<p>This application consists of a Flask frontend that anyone can remix with Ghostwriter.  The backend enables you to  to manage object storage in a distributed manner with the same S3 API that most developers are familiar with instead of being reliant on a single cloud region, data-center, or provider, the data is sharded into erasure codes and streamed in parallel across a network of uncorrelated endpoints.</p>
<p>Check out the live app hosted on Replit Deployments <a href="https://storjdemo.replit.app/">here</a>.</p>
