<p>Hey teachers! Back to school is here and we&#39;ve got an update on our education products and pricing.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t already heard, we&#39;ve just released a new <a href="https://repl.it/teams">Teams for Education product</a>, which is is the easiest way to teach and learn programming online, on any device, with no setup (<a href="https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education">read our original blog post for more details</a>).</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but it&#39;s a crazy time we&#39;re all living through. Things are changing fast, and we at Repl.it want to do our part to support everyone who&#39;s learning or teaching Computer Science right now. We recognize for many schools and universities that this year&#39;s budget has already been allocated and it may be difficult to find the resources to pay for an account.</p>
<p>So if you are unable to find budget, please <a href="https://forms.gle/CNELwJDDVabKtpdp7">fill out this form</a>, and <strong>we will set you up with a free Teams for Education account for the fall semester.</strong></p>
<p>If you are able to find last minute budget and plan to use Repl.it, please sign up and <a href="https://repl.it/teams">create a paid account here</a>. We appreciate your commitment and support! (There will likely be perks, grandfathered lower pricing in the future, etc. if you do.)</p>
<p>If you have legacy materials in Classroom (or old education product) and still need access, after you&#39;ve created a team, just email us at <a href="mailto:contact@repl.it">contact@repl.it</a> and we can turn on access. Classroom will be replaced by Teams for Education in the future, so all new teachers should be using Teams.</p>
<p>Also just a reminder that we only collect students&#39; and teachers&#39; email addresses and do not collect other personal information. We never share that information with 3rd parties and only use it to send communications directly related to Repl.it. You can <a href="https://repl.it/site/privacy">read more here</a>. If there are any concerns, you and your students are also welcome to use the site freely and anonymously, without creating an account or sharing any information. Just <a href="https://repl.it/languages">go here</a> and choose the language you&#39;d like to program in. You won&#39;t be able to save your work to your account, use multiplayer, or create/submit assignments, but you can still code in the browser with no setup!</p>
<p>And check out the new <a href="https://docs.repl.it/tutorials/00-overview">tutorials</a> and free <a href="https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introHTMLCSS">HTML/CSS</a> and <a href="https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introPython">Python</a> curricula (including assignments in Repl.it) that we&#39;ve just released. This is a great way to get started with Repl.it for your students! </p>
<p>Lastly, as you are using Repl.it this fall, please send any feedback to <a href="mailto:contact@repl.it">contact@repl.it</a> or <a href="https://replit.canny.io/feedback/p/teams-education-beta-feedback">post here</a>. We&#39;d love to hear from you!</p>
