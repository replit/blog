<p>At Repl.it we focus on simplicity, speed, and, most importantly,
reliability. If you&#39;re using Repl.it as your primary or secondary IDE we want
you to be confident that the time you invest working on your code will never go
to waste.</p>
<p>Building on our <a href="new_repls">autosave feature</a>, the underlying infrastructure --
every repl has its own filesystem now -- we&#39;ve built an automatic revision
system that keeps every revision of code you&#39;ve ever written stored. The trouble
was, as many of you pointed out, there was no easy way to manage it. That&#39;s why
today we&#39;re excited to introduce Repl History, a page where you can view files,
drill down to view old revisions by day or by change, diff them against latest,
and finally easily restore them.</p>
<p>Here is a quick gif walkthrough:</p>

<p>You can access this from your repls dashboard or from individual repls by
clicking on the saved/history button.</p>
