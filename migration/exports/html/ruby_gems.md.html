<p>On the heels of our Node.js npm support <a href="node_modules">announcement</a>, we&#39;re pleased to announce that we now
support Ruby <a href="https://rubygems.org/">Gems</a> too. We&#39;re excited to have the Ruby
community join the fun.</p>
<p>The way it works is slightly different from our Node or Python
implementations. In Node or Python you simple require/import the module you&#39;d
like to use, and we&#39;ll automagically install the package for you. In Ruby,
unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t find a reliable way to map requires to Gems so we had
to go with a neat feature of Bundler:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisroos/0ddf618ac711abe0f465">bundler/inline</a> where
you can define your gemspec in the code. This works well for Repl.it because
we&#39;d like to make it easy for people to use the repl without having to add files.</p>
<p>Here is an example, this uses the gem <code>colorlize</code> to print an ascii drawing of the
American flag:</p>

<p>We&#39;re still working on improving this, look forward to the following the coming
days:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per repl caching: install once, there forever</li>
<li>Gemfile support</li>
</ul>
