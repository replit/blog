<p>The Replit x Weights &amp; Biases Machine Learning Hackathon was Replit’s very first machine learning-focused hackathon that took place on February 4-11, 2023 with participants selected from all over the world!</p>
<p>After applying and being accepted into the hackathon, participants hacked for seven days on their projects, using both custom machine learning models and fine-tuning existing ones, all by combining the power of Weights &amp; Biases and Replit. During the hackathon, builders collaborated and got help from mentors on our Discord (shout out to Morgan and Ayush!), worked through examples and demos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-yfJgKyCp4">opening ceremony</a> and our <a href="https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/replit/reports/Using-Replit-and-Weights-Biases--VmlldzozNDc4NjU1">list of resources</a>, and even documented their journeys using <a href="https://wandb.ai/icemastereric/Hackathon/reports/Machine-Learning-Hackathon--VmlldzozNTMyMjU1?accessToken=krubwnlyzd4w9ig5a9hormfoe0ygo2onct5p47pr5wwfq51j5epq7wgbi48z57d6">W&amp;B Reports</a>. </p>
<p>In the end, we gave away over 500,000 Cycles worth of prizes to the best projects created by combining the two technologies. Expert ML engineers from Weights &amp; Biases judged each project to decide the ultimate winners:</p>
<h2>And the winners are...</h2>
<h3>Honorable Mention</h3>
<p>We wanted to give a special shoutout to <a href="https://replit.com/@nirantk">@NirantK</a> for their proof of concept on how to use LLMs with Python to scale human effort. Using GPT-3, this demo fills in the correct model class and hyperparameters for a given script. <a href="https://replit.com/@NirantK/LLMs-for-Wandb-and-Replit?v=1">Test it out</a> and see if you’re convinced!</p>

<h3>Best Repl</h3>
<p>Generate synthetic kōans on-demand with <a href="http://replit.com/@vertinski">@vertinski</a>’s Zen Master GPT project. Some highlights of this project were the GPT-2 model fine-tuned on a custom dataset, and the clean, calm interface. <a href="https://replit.com/@vertinski/Zen-Master-GPT?v=1">Try it out for yourself</a> and get your Zen on!</p>

<h3>Best W&amp;B Report</h3>
<p><a href="http://replit.com/@icemastereric">@IcemasterEric</a> implemented Q-Learning from scratch in this project, and the result was an engaging, day-by-day documentation of their journey. After in-depth research, pixel art and game design, and some debugging, the final product certainly caught our attention. After you give the full <a href="https://wandb.ai/icemastereric/Hackathon/reports/Machine-Learning-Hackathon--VmlldzozNTMyMjU1?accessToken=krubwnlyzd4w9ig5a9hormfoe0ygo2onct5p47pr5wwfq51j5epq7wgbi48z57d6">Report</a> a read, you can <a href="https://replit.com/@IcemasterEric/Q-Learning-AI?v=1#game.py">play the game on Replit</a>!</p>

<h3>Grand Prize</h3>
<p>This project combined the best features of both Weights &amp; Biases and Replit – a robust Report and model, along with a polished, visually enthralling Repl. Without any previous ML experience, <a href="http://replit.com/@codingMASTER398">@codingMASTER398</a> used 40,000 images to train a Convolutional Neural Network on detecting specific filters in new images. For details on the process, check out the <a href="https://wandb.ai/coding398/Image%20Classifier/reports/Machine-Learning-Hackathon-Detecting-filters-in-images--VmlldzozNTM1OTQ3">Report</a>, and upload your own images to the <a href="https://replit.com/@codingMASTER398/Image-filter-remover?v=1">Repl</a> to find out what filters are detected.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who participated, and thank you to Weights &amp; Biases for sponsoring this hackathon! We can’t wait to see what else you build with machine learning on Replit. </p>
