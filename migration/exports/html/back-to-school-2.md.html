<p><em>Part 2 of our back-to-school series.</em> </p>
<p>Hi Teachers,</p>
<p>If our slightly quieter <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/replit-teams-for-education-office-hours-tickets-151837105871">Office Hours</a> are any indication, you&#39;re all getting busier with classes and settling into the new school year. If you are already hitting a lull and looking for some resources to spice up your curriculum, look no further! </p>
<p>This week, I&#39;m talking about the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/curriculum-hub">Replit Curriculum Hub</a> and other ways you can get inspiration and ideas for your projects and assignments.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Our <a href="https://blog.replit.com/curriculum-hub">Curriculum Hub</a> is where Teams for Education admins can access pre-built projects, lesson plans, instructions, and tests to import and utilize in their own teams.

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://replit.com/apps">Replit Apps</a> is a gallery to browse and discover new repls from the community. The best part? You and your students can look under the hood of projects you like and even fork them to remix your own versions!

</li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/replityt/">Replit YouTube channel</a> is a treasure-trove of tutorials on topics from <a href="https://youtu.be/hgReGsh5xVU">building a Kaboom game</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/offNSnE-F9k">creating a custom Slackbot</a>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Our <a href="https://community.replit.com/">teacher community forum</a> is a great place to find and share resources, brainstorm ideas, and get help.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Want to show off your own curriculum resources in the Curriculum Hub and get some $$$? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmvwugpvNlvpVGvkticht5LMn3d5YLw16jHU1JP_qQ1iPrwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Submit a proposal!</a> </p>
</li>
<li><p>Our friends at <a href="https://blog.replit.com/fcc">freeCodeCamp</a> are busy developing new Rust and Python web development (with Flask + replit.web) and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/building-a-data-science-curriculum-with-advanced-math-and-machine-learning/">Data Science curriculum</a>.
