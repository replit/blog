<p>During EdFest 2022 we started our first Mini Curriculum Jam where anyone with an interest in education was asked to submit a sample project and a video outlining a curriculum that they&#39;d like to build. Our panel of judges (including Sean Glantz, Craig&#39;n&#39;Dave and our Student Panel) have spent the last two-weeks reviewing and scoring the entries and the winners are here!</p>

<li>Harry and Anna Wake, 14 year olds with their own start up: Mission Encodeable, with their entry that teaches <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egW1afe-SFw">APIs in Python through building a about joke text sender</a> </li>
<li>James Abela, a Computer Science teacher, with his project on building a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-IOxSZswA">weather app with real world data</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/kodylow">Kody</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/niftynei">Lisa</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/base58btc">Base58</a> who wanted to build out a curriculum all about a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhVJGHPILDs">Bitcoin app and CLI tool</a>, teaching the blockchain along the way!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to everyone that went to the effort of building something for us! We appreciate you (and we were <em>really</em> impressed with the quality of all the entries)! </p>
<p>We&#39;re all looking forward to seeing these full curricula appear in the Curriculum Hub soon!</p>
