<p>Since we introduced <a href="http://replit.com/templates">templates</a>, many of you have asked to get in on the action. We have some amazing community templates already, but we want to get everyone involved.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been hard at work revamping both the templates page and publishing flow so that everyone can create and publish a template. We&#39;re rolling this out over the next week, so keep your eyes peeled!</p>
<p>To celebrate this new release, on May 23rd, we&#39;re bringing Template Jam <a href="https://replit.com/talk/announcements/template_jam-EXTENDED/33491">back</a>. This time there will be $10,000 USD in prizes and you&#39;ll have the power of <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix">Nix</a> behind you. </p>
<p>We&#39;re excited to see all the wonderful templates you create, and brand new ways for people to create on Replit.</p>

<h3>What are templates and how do I make one?</h3>
<p>Templates are repls that serve as a starting point for others to build on top of. </p>
<p>Templates can be blank repls with support for a single language like many of the official templates are. Or they can be <a href="https://replit.com/@templates/Portfolio-Site-Template?v=1">portfolio website starter kits</a> or <a href="https://replit.com/@frissyn/PyPI-Package-Template?v=1">PyPi package templates</a>. They can also be tutorials for languages or frameworks. The possibilities are endless, really.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl">these docs</a> on how to configure a repl to get your template working with any language or framework.</p>
<h3>What kind of templates should I make?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s up to you! Our community has some ideas on what templates they&#39;d like to see if you want some inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> starter</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a> exercises</li>
<li>A <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started">React Native</a> starter</li>
<li>A <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/">Chrome extension</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And our team has some ideas on things we&#39;d like to see as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple static hosted blog without a frameworkâ€”like <a href="https://blog.replit.com/__repl">Replit&#39;s own</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/">Figma Plugins</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/topics/shopify-theme-development">Shopify theme</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html">Phoenix LiveView</a></li>
<li>An <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant">Oculus app starter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sonic-pi.net">Sonic Pi</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>How can I submit my template for Template Jam?</h3>
<p>Publish a repl to the community as a template and add the tag <code>#templatejam</code>. It&#39;s that simple!</p>
<p>We will start collecting submissions May 23rd at 12:00 AM PST, and stop collecting submissions June 23rd at 11:59 PM PST. </p>
<h3>How are winners decided?</h3>
<p>You&#39;ll have two ways to win!</p>
<p>The first $5,000 in prizes will be awarded by a panel of judges reviewing templates based on several criteria. This panel will include some Replit team members and a couple of guest judges. When reviewing, we&#39;ll be asking ourselves questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How useful is it? <em>Does it extend the capabilities of what people can build on Replit?</em></li>
<li>How easy is it to use? <em>Can a beginner press run and it just works?</em></li>
<li>How well does it make use of Replit&#39;s features? (i.e. Replit DB, Kaboom.js, Repl Auth, LSP, packager, debugger, etc.)</li>
<li>Is it well-documented? <em>Is it easy to understand what&#39;s going on?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The second $5,000 in prizes will be awarded based on a secret formula that will measure community reception of the templates in the month following the end of submission.</p>
<h3>How much can I win?</h3>
<p>You can win anywhere from $50 USD up to $5,000 USD.</p>
<h3>How many templates can I submit ?</h3>
<p>You can submit as many templates as you like! There is no limit.</p>
<h3>Can I remix existing templates?</h3>
<p>Yes, as long as you&#39;re adding original ideas and putting an effort to meaningfully change or improve the template.</p>
