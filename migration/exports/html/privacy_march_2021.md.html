<p>At Replit our mission is to make programming more accessible to everyone, everywhere, and as we&#39;ve been <a href="https://blog.repl.it/global">going global</a>, we know that we have to comply with various privacy laws and regulations around the world, so that you can focus on coding, not privacy compliance.</p>
<p>To that end, today we updated our privacy policy and terms and conditions to detail how we are compliant with FERPA, COPPA, GDPR, CCPA, and many other privacy regulations. Our terms also now include a Data Processing Agreement covering the proper transfer of data for EU and UK customers and a Student Data Protection Addendum for US educational institutions.</p>
<p>We also removed the Google Analytics script and cookie from Replit. We still use it on the back-end, but it does not track you.</p>
<p>The following documents have been updated or added:</p>

<p>We believe that these changes better protect you and your data, but as always if you have any concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@repl.it">privacy@repl.it</a>.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
