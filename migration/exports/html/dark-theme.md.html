<p>Dark Theme has long been one of the most highly request features on Repl.it.  We introduced a dark theme editor some time back, but as the rest of the workspace was still in &quot;Repl.it Light Mode&quot;, we knew our work wasn&#39;t done.  We are proud to announce the release of &quot;Repl.it Dark&quot; - a dark theme for the entire workspace!</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/darkmode-gif.gif" alt="gif of darkmode in action"></p>
<p>To enable Dark Mode, just go to any workspace, open up the Options/Settings pane on the sidebar, and select &quot;dark&quot; as your theme.</p>

<p>And voila!  Your entire workspace should then change to darkmode!</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be iterating on the darkmode to improve its look.  Have any feedback?  Leave us a suggestion <a href="https://repl.it/feedback/p/dark-mode-for-user-interface-more-themessyntax-highlighting">here</a>.  Furthermore, we designed it in a way where in the future, you&#39;ll be able to create and share your own themes for the Repl.it workspace!</p>
<p>What&#39;s next?  Maybe Repl.it Dark Theme everywhere?  Maybe Custom Themes?  What would you like to see?  Let us know on our <a href="https://repl.it/feedback">feedback boards</a>.</p>
