<p>Weights and Biases is a machine learning platform that tracks everything you need to make your models reproducible – from hyperparameters and code to model weights and dataset versions. If you’ve never worked with W&amp;B, check out this <a href="https://replit.com/@wandb">example Repl</a> for an introduction!</p>
<p>The total prize pool is over 500,000 Cycles – there are multiple opportunities to win, with prizes for <a href="https://wandb.ai/wandb/intro/reports/Some-of-our-Favorite-Reports--VmlldzozMTAzNjQ3">Best Weights &amp; Biases Report</a>, Best Repl, an Honorable Mention, and of course, the Grand Prize of 300,000 cycles. </p>
<h2>How do I participate?</h2>
<p>To start off, you’ll need to register for the waitlist which you can do <a href="https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/">here</a>. If selected to participate, you’ll receive an email with all of the details, including access to GPUs and a <a href="https://docs.replit.com/cycles/about-cycles">Cycles</a> stipend to power your project. Teams and individuals over the age of 13 are eligible to enter, and one entry per person/team is permitted. You’ll need a Replit account, as well as a <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights &amp; Biases</a> account, to participate. </p>
<p>The Machine Learning Hackathon will take place from February 4th to 11th, 2023. On February 4th, join us for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/4-yfJgKyCp4?feature=share">live opening ceremony</a> where we’ll work through a tutorial, announce the prizes, and review the rules for submission!</p>
<p>To submit your project, you’ll return to the <a href="https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/">site</a> and use the submission form, making sure to select which prizes you wish to compete for! To be eligible for the Best Replit Project prize, you’ll also need to <a href="https://docs.replit.com/hosting/sharing-your-repl">publish your work</a> to <a href="https://replit.com/community/all">Community</a> with the #wandb tag. All projects must be submitted by 11:59PM PST on February 11, 2023.</p>
<p>When the hackathon ends and all projects are submitted, the judges have 4 days to choose the winners. The judges will be choosing the winners based on the prize categories listed on the <a href="https://machine-learning-hackathon.replit-community.repl.co/">site</a>. Be sure to tune in to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BP4J1Gno2A">closing ceremony livestream</a> on YouTube on February 15th to hear us announce the winners live!</p>
<h2>Resources to Get Started</h2>
<p>If you’re just getting started with your machine learning journey, not to worry – we’ve got plenty of resources to get you setting up your models and making discoveries in no time. </p>
<p>We&#39;re also hosting Weights &amp; Biases CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/l2k">Lukas Biewald</a> and our very own <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad">Amjad Masad</a> for a fireside chat on the future of ML on January 18th, where we&#39;ll show off what you can do when you combine the power of W&amp;B and Replit. Join us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFsj9V6-1NE">live</a> or watch on-demand anytime on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@replit">YouTube channel</a>. </p>
