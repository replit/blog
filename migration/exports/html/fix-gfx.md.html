<p>Since we introduced <a href="https://blog.repl.it/gfx">native graphics in the browser</a> in 2019, our community has built awesome games and programs in <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÃ–VE</a>, <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame</a>, and Java Swing. Being able to write some code and see the results right away is what Replit is all about. That and finding peace in a bouncing DVD logo:</p>

<p>As more and more people have built graphics repls, they&#39;ve uncovered bugs. Our most frequent bug reports involve X11 not starting, leaving people looking a blank frame instead of running their code. We have heard you! Fixing graphics is now the Platform Team&#39;s top priority. We&#39;ll fix the outstanding bugs as quickly as we can. Judging by <a href="https://blog.repl.it/how-far">the last time</a> we went on a fixing spree, graphics should feel significantly better soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for building on Replit! More soon.</p>
