<p>Last week, Heroku announced they are discontinuing their free hosting plan. We get it. Offering free hosting and compute is extremely challenging, but there are many creators globally that are unable to pay for resources. As a result, many Heroku users are moving over to Replit, and we&#39;re excited!</p>
<p>At Replit, we believe anyone should be able to create software, and we will continue to create pathways for users to host their projects without swiping a credit card. Not only that, but we are taking it to new levels.</p>
<p>Today, we <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1562883942482513921?s=20&t=0AR97QsZnEcaCaL1WSA8MA">host 1M <em>concurrent</em> containers</a> and serve 10b+/month in dynamic content from apps deployed on Replit. At this scale, we are one of the largest compute providers in the world. But we&#39;re only getting started. In the coming months, we&#39;re going to radically change our hosting offering.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1537168642076332032?s=20&t=0AR97QsZnEcaCaL1WSA8MA">set</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1537168642076332032?s=20&t=0AR97QsZnEcaCaL1WSA8MA">super ambitious goals</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>10x performance and reliability</li>
<li>3x the nines of availability</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we&#39;re going to unlock:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full vertical scalability</li>
<li>Arbitrary storage capability</li>
<li>LLMs and Image generators</li>
</ul>
<p>In parallel, we are working on additional perfomance features and with best-in-class partners for powerful <a href="https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1552350731163734018?s=20&t=0AR97QsZnEcaCaL1WSA8MA">SDKs, APIs, &amp; databases.</a> One drawback of hosting on Replit is that it&#39;s hard to create different production vs development environments, but that is also getting solved.</p>
<p>In the next 2 months, we&#39;ll be introducing a deployment product. We think it will be the easiest way to deploy apps. </p>
<p>While Replit&#39;s free plan is and will continue to be robust, we&#39;ve also introduced a credit system known as <strong>Cycles</strong> so developers can spend as much or as little as they want to power an app. This will give builders access to elastic resources while also having complete control of their spend.</p>
<h2>Moving to Replit</h2>
<p>We built a <a href="https://replit.com/heroku">custom Heroku to Replit import flow</a> so you can easily clone your Heroku projects onto Replit. You can do so in three simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://replit.com/heroku">replit.com/heroku</a></li>
<li>Paste the link to your GitHub repository. If your repo is private, authenticate with GitHub first.</li>
<li>Select the repo, language, and owner of the Repl. Replit will also try to detect the language of your repository automatically for you!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let&#39;s make this fun</h2>
<p>Tweet your hosted Replit project at @Replit or @amasad and get a chance to win 1,000 cycles. <a href="https://cycles.replit.com/">Cycles</a> is Replit&#39;s credit system. They can be used to purchase power-ups like private, always-on, and boosted repls. We&#39;re so excited to see all of your amazing projects hosted on Replit. </p>
