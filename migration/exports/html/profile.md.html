<p>We&#39;re constantly surprised and delighted by the creativity of people in our
community. Whether it be games, animations, utilities, or simply snippets to
answer Stackoverflow questions -- it&#39;s always fascinating to see! However, we
haven&#39;t done a good job giving credits to authors for their creations.</p>
<p>We&#39;re changing this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#39;re giving you, dear Repl.it user, your own user profile.</li>
<li>Your repls will have your picture and name on the top left hand section above
the editor.</li>
</ol>
<h3>User profiles</h3>
<p>Right now, you can go to your <a href="/account">account</a> and start crafting your user
profile. You can change your profile picture (it defaults to your
<a href="https://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> if you have one), add a bio (complete with
links to your website or social media accounts), and if you want, even add a
school, company, organization or whatever institution you belong to.</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/edit_profile.png" alt="edit profile"></p>
<p>Then visit your profile either by following the link on the account page or by
going to the url <code>repl.it/@&lt;your username&gt;</code> (replacing <code>&lt;your username&gt;</code>
with your actual username). You can then share it publicly, or link to it from other
places on the web.</p>
<p><img src="/public/images/blog/profile.png" alt="profile"></p>
<p>Finally, you&#39;ll notice that we try to rank your repls in an intelligent way
(based on metadata, views, and other metrics) to show your most valuable work up
top.</p>
<p>(If you&#39;re a Repl.it teacher, and have contributed to our community classrooms
then we&#39;ll also list your public contributions).</p>
<h3>Sharing repls</h3>
<p>Next, when you share a repl, your audience can see that it was made by
you. Above the editor, on the upper left-hand side, will be your profile picture
and name. Clicking on either would take the viewer to your profile page.</p>

<h3>A note about our community</h3>
<p>Community features came as a natural evolution of our platform and have been
some of the top requested features by our users. So as we build up our community
we want to emphasize that we&#39;re dedicated to building a kind,
inclusive, and fun community. If at any point, dear Repler, you feel that
someone is acting unkindly towards you, or for any other reason you feel
unwelcome please get in touch with us and we&#39;ll make sure resolving your issue
is a top priority.</p>
<p>Happy repling!</p>
