<p>Some changes and fixes we make don&#39;t deserve their own blogpost. So we thought a
good way to keep you up-to-date is to collect however many that could be of
interest and write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog">&quot;Changelog&quot;</a>.</p>
<h2>IDE Changes</h2>
<h3>ES2015 imports from npm</h3>
<p>A couple of months ago we <a href="npm">announced</a> that you can <code>require</code> any package
from npm. But some of you have moved past the archaic ways of CommonJS and
wanted support for ES6. So that&#39;s why we&#39;re glad to bring ES6 import
support. Check <a href="/IYQ3">this</a> out.</p>
<h3>Python turtle keyboard support</h3>
<p>So you want to move your turtle? We got you. Check <a href="/IYQ8">this</a> out.</p>
<h3>Bigger Python turtle canvas</h3>
<p>It&#39;s much hard to run out of space; you can scroll around or expand your screen
to see what your turtle did.</p>
<h2>Classroom changes</h2>
<h3>Monospace in instructions</h3>
<p>For inline code notice that you can now style your words with &quot;monospace&quot; in our
classroom instructions editor.</p>
<h3>Change assignment &quot;scheduled at&quot;</h3>
<p>You couldn&#39;t change your assignment publish date unless you unpublish. Now you
can do that.</p>
