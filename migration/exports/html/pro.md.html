<p>Today, we are launching a new plan for you to speed up your development with Replit&#39;s AI tools and an even more powerful Workspace. </p>
<p>What is included in the Pro plan?</p>
<p><strong>All the benefits from the entry Hacker plan:</strong> Unlimited Private Repls, one Always On, and one Boost that you can apply to any of your Repls.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><strong>A more powerful Workspace:</strong> Anytime you are actively coding, your Workspace will have 4 GB Memory, 4 vCPUs  —  double what you would get with Hacker. This will enable you to build more resource-intensive apps, and things like code intelligence and build times will be faster.</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><strong>Ghostwriter:</strong> Replit’s coding assistant, with Complete, Generate, Transform, and Explain Code. For a limited time, Pro customers will get free access to the Ghostwriter Chat Beta, the first conversational AI in an IDE, complete with a proactive Debugger, and awareness of your project’s context. </p>
<p>Until now, Ghostwriter was only available via Replit’s virtual tokens, Cycles. With the Pro plan, you get the best development experience on Replit, in one easy-to-manage plan. </p>
<p>You can purchase the Pro plan for $20/month or $220/year. </p>
