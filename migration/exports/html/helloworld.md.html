<p>We&#39;re excited to launch this new part of our site.[](preview end) First, we have a place to
share with you all the exciting features we&#39;re building (things that don&#39;t fit
in a <a href="https://twitter.com/replit">140 characters</a> and a GIF). You can also look
forward to posts sharing what we learn in engineering and design.</p>
<p>Second, we&#39;re putting all the informational pages for our product and company
here. This way you don&#39;t have to download tons of JavaScript that is intended
for the development environment when all you want to do is read words. That&#39;ll
also make it easier for Google to index our stuff.</p>
<p>For now, you can check out our new <a href="/site/about">about us page</a>, sign up
for our <a href="/site/classrooms">classroom product beta</a>, or checkout our new
languages <a href="/languages/java">landing pages</a>.</p>
