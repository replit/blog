<p><em>-- a teacher giving us feedback.</em></p>
<p>At Repl.it we&#39;re always open to feedback; and supporting the teachers and
students that are using our platform is our top priority. We know that teaching is hard
but it&#39;s easliy one of the most impactful jobs when done correctly.</p>
<p>As mentioned in my post about <a href="assignment-reordering">assignment reordering</a> --
we&#39;re making it possible for teachers to enable assignment dependencies which will
require students to complete an assignment before moving on to the next one. This
is optional but it makes sense to enable if you designed your material to be
expereinced in a certain order.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#39;re always thinking about the best way students learn, that’s why we
decided to make locked assignments accessible as read only on the student
end. This means: students will be able to read the assignment but won&#39;t be able
edit or submit. We think by allowing this, students can prepare
themselves for upcoming assignments and it would help them to form an
idea of what’s coming next.</p>

<p>If you want to hide assignments from your students you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep them as drafts and publish them when you&#39;re ready</li>
<li>Schedule them to be published at a certain date</li>
</ul>
