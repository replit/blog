<p>For the month of July, our Repl.it IRL will be taking place on July 11th from 4 to 7 PM at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/CQpvexqXKbn">Bradfield School of Computer Science</a>!</p>
<p>We&#39;ll be having pizza and awesome people as always and, for this IRL, we will be starting with a show and tell session. For show and tell, people come up and present a project, whether it&#39;s a project they&#39;re working on or a cool open source project they like.</p>
<p>Once people who wanted to present have presented, we&#39;ll move into a mini hackathon with a given prompt (last time the prompt was to make an over complicated &quot;Hello World&quot; program) and spend the last portion of the IRL presenting people&#39;s progress and projects!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in attending, fill out the RSVP form at</p>
