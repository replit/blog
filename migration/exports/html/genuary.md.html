<p>You may have thought that we&#39;re in the month of January, but we&#39;re actually in the month of <a href="https://genuary.art/"><strong>Genuary</strong></a>! Genuary &quot;is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.&quot; </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been a part of the Replit community for a little while, you may remember <a href="https://creates.replit.com">Replit Creates</a>, our very own month-long celebration of creative coding that happened in August. We don&#39;t think making beautiful things should be confined to one month, so we&#39;ve decided to host a celebration of Genuary on Replit. </p>
<p>On the official <a href="https://genuary.art/">Genuary website</a>, there are <a href="https://genuary.art/prompts">prompts</a> for each day of the month, so we&#39;re also celebrating on Replit! Our Replit staff have made it even easier for you to participate by creating templates for some of the prompts, which you can find below.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also be hosting a Genuary Celebration on January 31st with special guest <a href="https://www.edsaber.info/">Saber Khan</a> from the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/">Processing Foundation</a>! Saber, along with Tyler and Ian from the Replit staff, will work through a Genuary prompt together and share other projects from the month-long challenge. Join us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZHgsFENK78">live</a> or watch on-demand anytime on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@replit">YouTube channel</a>. </p>
