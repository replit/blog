<p>Along with the ability to star repls and tag repls, we now take repl organization one step further with the ability to search through your repls.</p>
<p>You can use the search function in your repls dashboard in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by keyword</li>
<li>by title</li>
<li>by tag</li>
<li>by language</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="/site/docs/repls-search">search docs</a> for detailed instructions on how to use it.</p>
