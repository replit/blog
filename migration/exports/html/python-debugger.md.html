<h2>Debug your Python3 programs from your browser</h2>
<p>At Repl.it, our goal is to make programming more accessible, and as part of this
we aim to provide the full power of popular programming environments with no
setup time. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an understatement to say that debugging is
the majority of what we, as programmers, do. [](preview end)</p>
<p>That&#39;s why today we&#39;re making it possible to step-debug through your Python 3
code right from the browser. We&#39;ve built a new debug pane that makes it easy
step in, out, over, and resume your code. All the common operations a typical
debugger would do.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oerWaQR.gif" alt="debugger"></p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>write your code</li>
<li>click the &quot;debug&quot; button on the top right corner of the editor</li>
<li>a debug pane will pop-up underneath the console</li>
<li>this allows you step through your code</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is still in Beta and we have a lot we want to improve on it. The
obvious thing that we&#39;ll be adding shortly is support for breakpoints. But
that&#39;s not all, we want this to be on parity with the best debuggers in
industry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add breakpoint support.</li>
<li>Add a scope pane to see what variables are in scope and what are their values.</li>
<li>Evaluate expressions in context.</li>
<li>Add watch expressions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Give it a spin on this recursive <a href="https://repl.it/E9oT">factorial program</a>.</p>
<p>Let us know if you hit any bugs or if you have any feature requests. Happy debugging!</p>
