<p>Teachers, educators, and administrators, we&#39;ve heard your concerns about privacy. We&#39;re excited to announce a new feature for <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">Teams for Education</a>, Private Invites, designed specifically to keep students&#39; (including those under the age of 13) information private. Click here to <a href="https://repl.it/teams">create a team</a>.</p>
<p>Now when you are inviting students to a Teams for Education team, you can choose to generate a private invite link. When you share that link (for example by emailing it outside of Repl.it to your students or by pasting the link into your LMS or curriculum), then we will not ask students to provide names, emails, or other personal information when they sign up. Neither you nor the students will need to provide us with that information. Students will also have view-only access to the <a href="https://repl.it/talk/all">Repl Talk forum</a>, so they can still see all the great content, guides, and tutorials from the community, while protecting their privacy.</p>

<p><em>Note: that the free/anonymous plan, which doesn&#39;t require login, has always been and remains compliant with privacy regulations. We allow anyone to code for free in the browser. You just won&#39;t get all the great extras available in our upgraded plans. Interested? <a href="https://repl.it/languages">Start coding now</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Can Repl.it’s services be used in schools?</h2>
<p>Yes. Using Teams for Education, teachers can set up their own accounts and email students directly to invite them to use the service. Students can create accounts and use Teams for Education without providing personal information like names or email addresses.  </p>
<h2>What data does Repl.it collect about students through Teams for Education?</h2>
<p>We do not ask students to provide personal information during the sign up process. When students are invited to create an account on Repl.it, we only ask them to enter a username that does not include their real name. We do not ask them to provide their name, email address, or any other personal information during sign up. Like all online services, we receive Log Information (as defined in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>) when students use the services.</p>
<p>We do not allow students to post on our public forums. Students can still benefit from the forums, though, because they are not restricted from viewing them.</p>
<h2>How does Repl.it use student data?</h2>
<p>We only use the student data we collect for the purposes for which it was provided to us – that is, to perform services for the school and otherwise support the internal operations of our Service. Please see the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0">FTC’s COPPA FAQs</a> for more detail on what “support for internal operations” includes.</p>
<p>We do not disclose student data to third parties other than our own subprocessors. We also implement appropriate technical, physical and administrative security measures to protect students’ information.</p>
<h2>Can students under 13 use Repl.it in compliance with COPPA?</h2>
<p>With Teams for Education, students under 13 can use Repl.it in compliance with COPPA. As noted above, we do not ask students (including students under 13) to provide personal information during sign up and we do not allow them to post in our public forums. The only COPPA-covered personal information we collect from students under 13 is Log Information and, as noted above, we only use that information to provide services for the school and otherwise support the internal operations of our Service. Because the only COPPA-covered personal information we collect is Log Information and we only use that information to support the internal operations of our Service, “verifiable parental consent” is not required for students to use our Service.</p>
<p>In addition, consistent with COPPA, we do not disclose student data to third parties other than our own subprocessors, and we implement appropriate measures to protect students’ information.</p>
<h2>Can Repl.it be used in compliance with FERPA?</h2>
<p>When we contract with schools to use Teams for Education, we do not collect information about students that can be used to identify or contact them, such as a name and email address from students.  We only collect student’s Log Information (as defined in our <a href="https://repl.it/site/privacy">privacy policy</a>) and use this limited data for the purposes for which it was provided to us, that is, to perform services for the school and support our internal operations. We do not disclose data to third parties other than our own subprocessors.</p>
<h2>Is this update reflected in your Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We have also updated our <a href="https://repl.it/site/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> in accordance with this change.</p>
<h2>Will you sign our university&#39;s, school&#39;s or district&#39;s Data Security or Privacy Agreement?</h2>
<p>At this time, we are reviewing Data Security and Privacy Agreements for individual partners. If you would like us to review your agreement, please email: <a href="mailto:sales@repl.it">sales@repl.it</a>.  </p>
