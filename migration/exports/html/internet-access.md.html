<p>Repl.it is quickly becoming a tool that&#39;s used in everyday programming, and our
users are building all sorts of amazing programs. One thing that&#39;s been missing
for a long time is the ability to access the internet from repls. Being able to
call APIs or remote servers is something programmers can&#39;t live without. That&#39;s
why we&#39;re excited to announce that starting now we&#39;re openning internet access
for all!</p>
<p>Previously, only users with a paid plan could run repls with internet access,
and everyone else would get an error. (Read more about our <a href="pricing-update-2018">pricing
update</a>)</p>
<p>This means that you can now write and run repls that scrape data or access APIs,
regardless of whether you have a paid subscription or not.  Sharing or embedding
an internet-accessing repl will also work for those using it - so if you wanted
to use Repl.it to write examples for your public-facing API, now you can do so
without worry!</p>
