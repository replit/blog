<p>When we want to support a new technology, we&#39;re faced with the question: &quot;Do we (the Replit team) build this capability into the Replit directly, or can our users add it themselves?&quot;. Usually, we want the answer to be the latter. Repls are like personal computers for your projects. And the more these personal computers can be customized, the more they&#39;ll be used in creative, unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Internally, we refer to the extent to which a Repl can be configured as &quot;Repl Space&quot;. So when we talk about building new features, we always ask &quot;can it be done in Repl Space?&quot;, which is basically asking if we can build it <em>on</em> Replit. Over the past year, Repl Space has become <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix">significantly more powerful</a>, and soon, Replit will be one of the most flexible computing platforms on the planet without compromising its simplicity. Now that we have the technical foundations in place, we&#39;re excited to bring more of that power into the product in the form of Templates and some new configuration options.</p>
<h2>Templates</h2>

<h3>Where can I find templates?</h3>
<p>Whenever you create a Repl, you&#39;ll be able to search through our list of Templates and start coding immediately. We also built a new templates <a href="https://replit.com/templates">gallery</a> that lets you search and browse official and community templates. Publishing community templates is currently limited, but here&#39;s a preview of what it looks like to add a Zig template, for example:</p>

<p>Eventually we&#39;ll expand the ability to publish templates to more community members. If you&#39;re interested in publishing a template, you can <a href="https://forms.gle/8mUgEQbkeFFwZqct5">sign up here</a>.</p>
<h3>How do I configure a template?</h3>
<p>A repl is configured using 2 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>replit.nix</code>: This file specifies the Nix packages to install into the repl. For example: compilers, language servers, debuggers, cli tools.</li>
<li><code>.replit</code>: This file specifies how the repl operates. For example: The command to execute when the run button is pressed or which LSP server to run for a given language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a <code>replit.nix</code> file that installs <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/zls">Zig Language Server</a>, and <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/">gdb</a>. The environment is <a href="https://blog.replit.com/nix-perf-improvements">automatically cached</a> by default to ensure fast repl startup time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nix">{ pkgs }: {
    deps = [ pkgs.zig pkgs.zls pkgs.gdb ];
}
</code></pre>
<p>And here is an example of configuring <code>.replit</code> to customize the <code>run</code> command, which is executed when you press the run button.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># this will run the main zig file inside of your Repl.
run = [&quot;zig&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;src/main.zig&quot;]
</code></pre>

<h2>The future</h2>
<p>We&#39;re working on making Repl Space even more powerful. Ideally, we&#39;re headed towards being able to make, share, and collaborate on all kinds of customized computing environments– not just for writing code, but for gaming, drawing, and more.</p>
